<br />A NEW CUB</h2>
<p>Skillfully, Dan Carter dribbled the basketball
down the polished gymnasium floor. With an easy
toss of his right hand, he looped it neatly through
the basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice going, Dan,&rdquo; approved Brad Wilber, the
Den Chief, who directed the Cub Scout practice.</p>
<p>The five boys, all members of Den 2, were practicing
in the basement of First Methodist Church.
Now after a brisk half-hour work-out, they were
ready to adjourn to the upstairs clubroom for their
weekly business session.</p>
<p>Dan tossed the ball to Midge Holloway, who
passed it to Red Suell. The latter shot a fast one to
Chips Davis, who fumbled. He awkwardly recovered
the ball, but in attempting a basket, missed it
by several inches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Butter fingers; Butter fingers!&rdquo; mocked a voice
from the basement window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">[2]</div>
<p>The Cubs had not realized that they were being
watched. Turning quickly toward the wall behind
them, they saw several boyish and jeering faces
pressed against the rain-streaked panes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Pat Oswald and his gang,&rdquo; Brad instantly
recognized them. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pay any attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acting on the Den Chief&rsquo;s suggestion, the Cubs
tried to ignore the boys at the window. But it was
quite impossible.</p>
<p>Nervous because he knew he was being watched,
Dan tried a long shot from mid-floor, and missed
the basket. Again Pat and his followers hooted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at &rsquo;im!&rdquo; one of the tormentors yelled. &ldquo;Why,
even a girl could do better than that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan could not endure the taunt. He walked over
to the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yeah?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re so
good you never miss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead-eye Pat, that&rsquo;s me name!&rdquo; the older boy
boasted. &ldquo;Come on, guys, let&rsquo;s show &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boldly, he pushed open the window which swung
on hinges. Before the Cubs could stop him, Pat
shoved his muscular torso through the opening, and
leaped down onto the gymnasium floor. Behind
him, like so many spry grasshoppers, came three of
his cronies. The boys ranged in age from 7 to 11
years, but all were gangling and over-sized.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">[3]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you!&rdquo; Red Suell cried furiously. &ldquo;Get out of
here! You got no business coming in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah, yah, yah!&rdquo; mocked Pat. He gave Red a hard
shove, deliberately tearing the basketball from his
grasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, fellows!&rdquo; he urged his gang. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
show these babies how to play ball!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dribbled in beneath the basket. Without appearing
to take aim, he carelessly hooked the ball
up toward the netting. Neatly, it swished through.</p>
<p>Despite their annoyance, the Cubs were impressed.
Pat was plently good! No argument about that.
His flashy skill so amazed them that they did not
try to recover the ball.</p>
<p>One of the invaders snatched and passed it back
to Pat. From that moment, it became a teasing,
tormenting game of &ldquo;keep it away from the Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no right to come in here and break up
our practice.&rdquo; Chips Davis accused hotly. &ldquo;Give me
that ball!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rushed in to snatch it. Pat with jeering laughter,
passed it on to another boy in his group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us our ball!&rdquo; Chips shouted again. &ldquo;If you
don&rsquo;t hand it over&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">[4]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yah, yah, yah,&rdquo; mocked Pat. &ldquo;Here it is, baby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He heaved the ball with terrific force. It struck
the surprised Chips in the pit of his stomach, doubling
him over.</p>
<p>At this moment, Sam Hatfield, the Cubmaster,
appeared in the gymnasium doorway. The athletic
coach and leader in the citywide Pack had a knack
of getting on well with all types of boys. Now, as if
he had noted nothing amiss, he commented cheerfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, I see we have some new recruits
today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recruits, nothing!&rdquo; snorted Midge Holloway.
&ldquo;These hoodlums are trying to take over the gym&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, we were only having a little fun,&rdquo; Pat
growled. Already he was edging toward the door.
&ldquo;Come on, fellows. Let&rsquo;s scram!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As quickly as they had come, the intruders were
gone. Mr. Hatfield waited until the door had slammed
behind them, and then asked Brad about the
youngsters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was Pat Oswald and his bunch from out
Bay Shore Road way,&rdquo; the Den Chief replied.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re always making trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">[5]</div>
<p>The Cubmaster offered no comment except to remind
the Cubs that it was time for the meeting to
start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Fred?&rdquo; Dan asked, noticing that Mr.
Hatfield&rsquo;s son was not with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s waiting upstairs in the meeting room,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s getting acquainted with our
new Den member.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;New member?&rdquo; Dan asked quickly. The other
Cubs, hearing the remark, gathered about to ask
questions. This was the first hint they&rsquo;d had that a
new boy had joined the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along and meet him,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield invited.</p>
<p>Chips, Red and Midge rushed on ahead up the
stone stairway. Deliberately, the Cub leader lingered
behind to speak privately to Brad and Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a special favor to me, I wish you fellows
would look after Chub,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Teach him
the ropes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chub?&rdquo; Dan questioned. &ldquo;The new Cub?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, his name is Charles Weldon.&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
hesitated slightly before he spoke the boy&rsquo;s surname.
Then he went on &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a shy youngster, not very
sure of himself yet. Don&rsquo;t tease him about his family
background. Don&rsquo;t ask questions, and don&rsquo;t let
the others do it either.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">[6]</div>
<p>Brad and Dan were astonished by the request for
usually Mr. Hatfield held to the theory that every
Cub should fend for himself. Who was Chub, they
wondered? Why had he never attended their school?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chub is new in Webster City,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said, as if picking the question from their minds.
&ldquo;Not much is known about his parents. He lives
with Mrs. Lornsdale at the west edge of town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he an orphan?&rdquo; Dan inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something like that,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield purposely was
vague as he locked the basketball into an equipment
case. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;ve told you all anyone needs to
know about Chub. No more questions. Pass the
word along that no one is to tease him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Dan agreed. &ldquo;Brad and I will look out for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their curiosity heightened by the information
Mr. Hatfield had given them, the two boys scarcely
could wait to meet the new Cub.</p>
<p>Brad and Dan both were &ldquo;veterans&rdquo; of the organization
and Mr. Hatfield depended upon them
a great deal. Brad was a serious, dark-haired youngster
of 13, and the only Boy Scout in the organization.
Even-tempered always, he had a quiet but
efficient way of getting things done.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_7">[7]</div>
<p>Though younger, Dan likewise was efficient and
highly reliable. A fine athlete for his years, he also
was quick in school and his original ideas helped
make the den a success. He had been chosen denner
because of his popularity.</p>
<p>Upstairs, the boys found Fred Hatfield waiting
with Chub.</p>
<p>Pouring into the cheerful club room, the Cubs
cast covert glances at the new boy.</p>
<p>Chub was 10, short and stubby, with a crop of
chocolate brown freckles. A thatch of yellow, curly
hair hung down almost to the bridge of his pug
nose. He did not have the blue Cub uniform, but
wore a suit with sleeves a trifle too short.</p>
<p>As Mr. Hatfield introduced the Cubs one by one,
Chub smiled shyly and stammered a few words.
The leader then started the meeting off with roll
call and a peppy song to the tune of &ldquo;America.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Cub friendships, pure and deep,</p>
<p class="t0">We promise we will keep</p>
<p class="t0">Our pledge to thee;</p>
<p class="t0">We will honor and obey Akela all the way</p>
<p class="t0">And on that twelfth birthday</p>
<p class="t0">Good Scouts we&rsquo;ll be!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">[8]</div>
<p>For Chub&rsquo;s benefit, Mr. Hatfield then explained
that to qualify as a Bobcat he must learn the Cub
Promise and to repeat the Law of the Pack. Other
requirements were that he understand the meaning
of WEBELOS, and know how to give the Cub sign
and handshake, the Cub motto and the salute.</p>
<p>A Bobcat, the leader further explained, signified
the first step in Cubbing. Other progressive ranks
were Wolf, Bear and Lion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Cub always does his part,&rdquo; he emphasized.
&ldquo;Above all, honor is his most sacred possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time Chub had begun to look worried. To
relieve his mind, Mr. Hatfield assured him that it
would not take long to learn all the essentials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other Cubs will help you,&rdquo; he promised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure we will,&rdquo; said Dan, picking up his cue.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield went on to say that the theme of the
Pack for that month would be to &ldquo;Know your Neighborhood.&rdquo;
Each den, he told the group, would be
given opportunity to visit interesting places in the
community.</p>
<p>At this point the talk was interrupted by a slight
scratching noise at one of the windows. The Cubs,
twisting in their chairs, again saw grinning faces
pressed against the glass panes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_9">[9]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pat and his gang!&rdquo; Red Suell exploded. &ldquo;Those
pests have been listening!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s drive &rsquo;em away!&rdquo; proposed Midge, jumping
up from his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not invite them inside?&rdquo; countered Mr.
Hatfield. With a smile, he started toward the window.</p>
<p>However, the Bay Shore boys, observing the Cubmaster&rsquo;s
approach, ducked back out of sight. With
a shrug, Mr. Hatfield resumed the meeting. He told
the Cubs more about the &lsquo;Know Your Community&rsquo;
visits which were being planned, and asked for
suggested trips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about one to the fire station?&rdquo; piped up
Chips eagerly. &ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;d let us ride the engine
on a trial run.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to visit a newspaper office.&rdquo; This proposal
came from Midge, whose father, Burton Holloway,
was an active Den Dad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The courthouse!&rdquo; suggested Dan. &ldquo;It would be
interesting to watch a trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other ideas came thick and fast. In fact, with the
exception of Chub, every boy immediately thought
of at least one place suitable for a Den visit.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">[10]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Chub doesn&rsquo;t know Webster City well, because
he hasn&rsquo;t lived here long,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield remarked.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll think of a place before our next meeting. His
suggestion may be the best of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Dan. &ldquo;All the places we&rsquo;ve
hit on so far are the obvious ones. Probably every
Den in Webster City will come up with the same
ones. I wish we could think of an out-of-the-way
place to visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chub will ring the bell,&rdquo; predicted Brad. &ldquo;Are
we to visit all the places, Mr. Hatfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the most interesting. After all the suggestions
are in, we&rsquo;ll vote on it. Now, one more matter.
About that party we&rsquo;re giving for the parents a
week from Friday night. Shall we serve real home-made
ice cream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell,&rdquo; approved Midge, smacking his lips.
&ldquo;Chocolate with nuts in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mothers have promised to furnish the cake,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield resumed. &ldquo;Angel food, spice and chocolate.
Making the ice cream will be our job. Know
where we can get a couple of old-fashioned ice
cream freezers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandmother had one, but I think she gave
it away,&rdquo; Dan said doubtfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">[11]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Large freezers may not be easy to find. Well, see
what you can do about it, boys, and report back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The afternoon meeting broke up quickly for the
hour was late. As the Cubs poured out of the club-room,
Dan brushed against Pat Oswald who had
been standing close to the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listening again!&rdquo; he said scornfully. &ldquo;If you
want to learn about Cub Scouts, why don&rsquo;t you come
inside instead of sneaking around like a cat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re calling me an alley cat?&rdquo; Pat demanded.
He doubled up his fists and glared at Dan. &ldquo;Say, I
ought to knock the stuffins out of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut it,&rdquo; Brad advised quietly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not getting
into a fight here in the churchyard. Or anywhere
else for that matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naw, the Cubs wouldn&rsquo;t fight,&rdquo; Pat jeered.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re yellow. Afraid of their sissy shadows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t even hang onto a basketball,&rdquo; Pat went on
with his tormenting. &ldquo;Sissies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And look at that little panty-waist with curls!&rdquo;
shouted one of the boys in Pat&rsquo;s gang. He had
singled Chub out for attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>Walking over to the shy boy, he gave his corduroy
suit jacket a hard jerk. Chub cringed back
into the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scared, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave Chub alone,&rdquo; Dan said, stepping in
front of the new Cub member.</p>
<p>The other boy fell back a step, but not because of
Dan&rsquo;s command. In truth, he had caught a glimpse
of Mr. Hatfield coming down the corridor to the
church doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What goes on here?&rdquo; the Cub leader demanded,
and this time his voice was stern.</p>
<p>With shouts of laughter, Pat and his followers
ran off down the street, rattling a string of tin cans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Pat is a mean one,&rdquo; Chips declared. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d
have started trouble if you hadn&rsquo;t come along, Mr.
Hatfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; conceded the Cub leader. &ldquo;Pat is inclined
to be a bully, but he&rsquo;s mostly bluff, I think.
My guess is that he and his pals really are envious
of the good times the Cubs have here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially of our basketball practice,&rdquo; added
Brad.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield advised the Cubs not to take Pat&rsquo;s
teasing too seriously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; he suggested as the group broke
with Brad. During the brisk walk, the younger boy
had little to say. Finally, Brad commented upon his
unusual silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worrying about where we can get a couple of
ice cream freezers, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly. I&rsquo;ll admit I was thinking about the
party though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something seems to be bothering you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering about Pat. He and his gang
were listening at the church door when we made
plans for the social a week from Friday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it,&rdquo; Dan insisted soberly. &ldquo;This is
what worries me. I&rsquo;m afraid Pat and his bunch may
show up at the party and really stir up a mess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad glanced down at the younger boy, surprised
by the intensity of his remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of borrowing trouble, aren&rsquo;t you, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; Dan admitted with a rueful laugh.
&ldquo;But Pat&rsquo;s a sly one. I sure hope I&rsquo;m wrong, but I&rsquo;m
terribly afraid he intends to try to break up our
Den.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>As the Cubs started home, Dan fell into step
up. &ldquo;If you work at the job, the Bay Shore boys may
be won over as friends. That would be much better
than having them as enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs were far from certain that they wanted
the Bay Shore boys as friends. However, they kept
their thoughts to themselves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">CHAPTER 2</span>
<br />IN QUEST OF A FREEZER</h2>
<p>The Carter kitchen was fragrant with the odor of
frying bacon as Dan bounced down the stairs next
morning for an eight o&rsquo;clock breakfast. It was Saturday
and a beautiful crisp October day. Dan had
plans for every hour ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mom,&rdquo; he began, sliding into his usual chair at
the foot of the breakfast table. &ldquo;Do you know where
I can get an ice cream freezer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s odd requests long since had ceased to astonish
Mrs. Carter. &ldquo;You mean the old fashioned
kind one turns with a crank?&rdquo; she asked, pouring
orange juice into tall glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need a couple of large ones,&rdquo; Dan explained.
&ldquo;Our Den is throwing a big party for the Mothers
and Dads. No freezer&mdash;no party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother had one, but that was long ago. Let
me think&mdash;oh, I recall the old Christian Church on
River Road had several large ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think I could borrow &rsquo;em, Mom?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That depends, Dan. The old church was abandoned
about a year ago. When last I heard, the
freezers and other kitchen equipment were stored
in the basement. I doubt any of them were moved
to the new church building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that his mother mentioned it, Dan recalled
that the Christian Church had been boarded up
nearly a year. The building had been offered for
sale, but so far no buyer had showed interest. Meanwhile,
the place was supervised by Terry Treuhaft,
an elderly caretaker, who had his own little cottage
not far from the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might talk to Mr. Treuhaft about it,&rdquo; Mrs.
Carter remarked. &ldquo;If the freezers are still there, I
see no reason why the Cubs shouldn&rsquo;t have them
for the party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll round up some of the Cubs and hike out to
his cottage,&rdquo; Dan decided. He buttered a second
slice of toast and scooped the last piece of bacon
from the platter. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s chances for a pack lunch,
Mom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairly good, I guess,&rdquo; his mother smiled. &ldquo;That
is, providing you rake the yard first. The leaves
have been falling fast.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mom! That will take an age. How about
doing it when I get back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Cub in hand is worth two on a hike, Dan.
Once you get away on such a lovely day as this, I
know I&rsquo;ll never see you again until nightfall. Work
before fun, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Dan gave in with a grin. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get right at
it. First, though, I want to call some of the Cubs to
ask them to hike with me to the old church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to invite the new boy,&rdquo; his mother
reminded him. &ldquo;Charles Weldon&mdash;is that his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We call him Chub. He&rsquo;s a queer one, Mom. Shy
as a mouse. I don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;d like to hike&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, be sure to invite him,&rdquo; Mrs. Carter
urged.</p>
<p>Dan felt a bit ashamed of not wanting Chub. It
wasn&rsquo;t that he had anything against the new Cub.
But somehow, he didn&rsquo;t feel as well acquainted with
him as he did with Chips, Midge, Red, Brad or
Fred.</p>
<p>To please his mother, he called Chub&rsquo;s home first
of all. The phone was answered by Mrs. Lornsdale,
the widow, with whom the boy lived.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>Charles was there, she said, and she was certain
he would want to join the group of Cubs. She promised
to have him meet the boys at the old church.</p>
<p>In rapid succession, Dan then called all the others
except Mack Tibbets who was out of town for two
weeks. To his disappointment, Brad Wilber could
not go, having work to do at home. Chips, Red and
Midge eagerly accepted the invitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come over to my house as soon as your lunch
is packed,&rdquo; Dan requested. &ldquo;I have to rake leaves,
but I&rsquo;ll be through before you can snap your bubble
gum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By eleven o&rsquo;clock, a huge pile of leaves at the
curb attested to the furious pace of Dan&rsquo;s labors.
Nevertheless, a third of the yard remained unraked
when Midge and Chips arrived with knapsacks
slung over their shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to help?&rdquo; Dan suggested hopefully. &ldquo;I got
an extra rake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two Cubs took turns and soon the work was
practically finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Red?&rdquo; Dan demanded.</p>
<p>Just then he glimpsed the red-headed youngster
coming down the walk dribbling a basketball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, where&rsquo;d you get that?&rdquo; Midge asked with
keen interest as the boy joined the group.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bought it with my paper money. Here, catch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red made a fast pass, and Midge, not expecting
the ball, missed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, you&rsquo;re awkward,&rdquo; Red teased. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t
improve, we&rsquo;ll have to get another forward on our
Cub team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over my dead body!&rdquo; Recovering the ball, Midge
threw it hard at Red, who also missed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks to me as if we all need more practice in
passing,&rdquo; Dan remarked as he put away the rakes.
&ldquo;Taking the ball with you on the hike, Red?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we&rsquo;ll get a chance to practice a bit after
lunch. Bring it along, Red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys started off for Terry Treuhaft&rsquo;s cottage,
only a block from the old Christian Church. Enjoying
the soft, balmy air, they scuffed along a river
path, between tall trees which rapidly were shedding
their bright-hued leaves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell day for a roast,&rdquo; Chips said, blinking in
the bright sun. &ldquo;I wish we&rsquo;d brought some weiners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys presently came within view of Terry
Treuhaft&rsquo;s white clapboard cottage. The church
caretaker, a bent old man with gnarled hands, was
building a fence in the back yard. He scarcely
glanced up as the boys halted beside him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>Finally as the hammering went on and on, Dan
introduced himself and explained the purpose of
the call. He told of the organization&rsquo;s need of ice
cream freezers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Mr. Treuhaft asked gruffly. &ldquo;Ice
cream at this time of year? Stuff and nonsense!
Fiddle Faddle! Why tell me about it anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Christian Church has some freezers in the
basement,&rdquo; Chips interposed. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you the caretaker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the angle?&rdquo; Old Terry hammered a nail
which went crooked into the board. He uttered an
enraged exclamation. &ldquo;Drat it! Can&rsquo;t you boys see
you&rsquo;re bothering me? I&rsquo;m busy as all get-out. I want
to finish this fence before sun down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do need the freezers,&rdquo; Dan persisted.
&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you let us have them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m busy,&rdquo; Old Terry repeated between loud
bangs of his hammer. &ldquo;Busy! I&rsquo;ve no time to go over
to the church now. Come back Monday or later in
the week and we&rsquo;ll talk about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about letting us have the key ourselves?&rdquo;
proposed Red. &ldquo;We could get the freezers and return
it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No one gets that key,&rdquo; Old Terry said with emphasis.
&ldquo;The trustees hold me responsible for everything
that is stored in the church. I&rsquo;m taking no
chances on a bunch of kids.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t touch anything,&rdquo; Red insisted, but
the caretaker cut him short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Move along, boys,&rdquo; he said crossly. &ldquo;I said come
back next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus dismissed, the Cubs trudged off, deeply
discouraged. Not even Dan had an idea where
another freezer could be obtained. Old Terry&rsquo;s attitude
annoyed the boys, for in Webster City the
Den 2 Cubs had earned a reputation for dependability.</p>
<p>On one occasion, the boys had by their quick and
efficient work, saved a pheasant raiser from losing
his most valuable birds in a flash flood. Even more
recently, they had enjoyed adventure in solving a
mystery. This story of their encounter with Indians,
has been told in the volume entitled, &ldquo;Dan Carter
and the Great Carved Face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may as well eat our lunch somewhere along
the river, and then go home,&rdquo; Midge proposed
glumly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s long past noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry too,&rdquo; Chips added. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s eat.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;First, we have to go to the church,&rdquo; Dan said.
&ldquo;I invited Chub to have lunch with us. He&rsquo;s been
waiting there an age now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little silence greeted Dan&rsquo;s announcement. But
the Cubs were too well trained in sportsmanship to
make pointed remarks about the new Den member.
Their very silence, though, told Dan that they
weren&rsquo;t too happy about including him in the outing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s move along then,&rdquo; Red said impatiently.
&ldquo;The quicker we find Chub, the quicker we eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little farther on, the Cubs came within view of
the old weatherbeaten Christian Church. The lawn,
once a velvety green, now was overgrown with
weeds. They were especially high in the old cemetery
on the slope leading down to the river.</p>
<p>The church building itself was in need of paint.
Roof shingles curled with age, and a tower bell had
reddened with rust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see Chub anywhere around here,&rdquo; Chips
declared, looking around the grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s around back,&rdquo; Dan said. He shouted
Chub&rsquo;s name several times.</p>
<p>Almost at once the Cubs heard pounding footsteps.
Chub came running around the corner of the
old church, his hair rumpled by the wind.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, I&rsquo;m glad you finally came,&rdquo; he cried, stammering
in his eagerness. &ldquo;It was sort of scarey waiting
here so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scarey?&rdquo; Red demanded. &ldquo;What is there to be
afraid of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old graveyard does have a spooky look,&rdquo;
Dan said quickly before Chub could answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t scare me,&rdquo; Red boasted. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
be afraid to come here alone at night either, I bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to try it?&rdquo; Chips caught him up.</p>
<p>Red let the challenge pass. The boys found a
grassy site at the rear of the building, and spread
out their sandwiches.</p>
<p>Dan discovered that his Mother had packed extra
fruit and cookies, so he shared them with Chub
who had brought only a peanut butter sandwich
and an apple.</p>
<p>Red, a fast eater, finished ahead of the others and
restlessly began to wander about. Soon he was peering
into the dusty basement windows of the church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you see?&rdquo; Dan inquired curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much of anything &rsquo;cept an old furnace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any sign of those ice cream freezers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see some cooking junk on one of the
shelves. Don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s a freezer or not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>Their interest whetted, the other boys gathered
up the loose picnic papers and went to join Red.
From another window on the opposite side of the
building, Dan obtained a much better view of the
cluttered basement interior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do see a freezer!&rdquo; he reported gleefully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, I wish we could have it,&rdquo; Red declared.
&ldquo;If we could just get down into the basement&mdash;say,
maybe we can find an unlocked window!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing,&rdquo; Dan said with firmness. &ldquo;Even
if we found one, we couldn&rsquo;t go into the building
after Old Terry told us to wait. Cub honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was only talking,&rdquo; Red answered with a
shrug. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really intend to go inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s window offered a fairly clear view of the
church basement, so the other boys crowded about
to peer down into the pillared room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place has a lot of boxes,&rdquo; Midge observed.
&ldquo;Some of &rsquo;em look as if they&rsquo;ve been smashed open.
I see some tools too. A coal shovel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice broke on the last named object and an
eerie silence came upon all the Cubs. Was it imagination,
or had they heard a strange sound&mdash;the
faint tap-tap-tap of the overhead church bell?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; Midge demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;G-ghosts,&rdquo; mumbled Chub, his voice choked with
fright. In a hushed whisper he added the plea:
&ldquo;Come on, f-fellows, let&rsquo;s get away from here
q-quick!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CHAPTER 3</span>
<br />A TAPPING BELL</h2>
<p>Chub&rsquo;s squeal of fright unnerved the other Cubs
for an instant. But they did not give way to panic.
Chips grasped the younger boy&rsquo;s arm, holding him
as he would have fled from the church grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any
ghosts and we all know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I-I heard something,&rdquo; Chub said, half ashamed.
&ldquo;It sounded like a bell tapping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs stood gazing up at the belfry. So far
as they could see, the rusty old bell hung absolutely
motionless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You imagined it,&rdquo; Red said gruffly. &ldquo;How could
that bell jingle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard it tap myself,&rdquo; Midge said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe the wind moved the bell,&rdquo; Red offered
as an explanation. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s blowing fairly strong from
the direction of the river.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>The other Cubs nodded agreement, satisfied that
the mystery was solved. Dan remained silent. He
too had heard the metallic sound which had startled
Chub, and has assumed it to be a tapping bell. But
to theorize that the wind had been responsible,
seemed silly.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, not caring to further alarm the
Cubs, he did not reveal his thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s practice basketball,&rdquo; Red urged
to break the uneasy silence which had fallen upon
the group. &ldquo;Here, Midge, catch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tossed the ball to his friend, who passed it
back. The boys spread out, palming the basketball
from one to another, faster and faster. Then they
played &ldquo;keep away&rdquo; for a few minutes. Chub was
less skillful than the other Cubs, frequently letting
the ball slip from his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I&rsquo;m so awkward,&rdquo; he said miserably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll catch on all at once,&rdquo; Dan encouraged him.
&ldquo;Here, pass me a fast, hard one now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chub swung the ball in a wide arch and heaved
with all his strength. His aim was distressingly bad.</p>
<p>The ball sailed high above Dan&rsquo;s reach, over the
bushes and through a window.</p>
<p>A stunned silence came upon the Cubs as they
heard the crash and beheld the damage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow! You&rsquo;ve done it now, Chub,&rdquo; Chips said
pityingly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll all catch it from Old Terry,&rdquo; Midge added,
staring at the jagged hole in the pane. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll
have to pay for the damage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a-all my fault,&rdquo; Chub admitted, close to
tears. &ldquo;How much do windows cost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a dollar or two,&rdquo; Midge said vaguely. &ldquo;Maybe
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears began to roll down Chub&rsquo;s cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it throw you,&rdquo; Dan said, slapping him
on the shoulders. &ldquo;Breaking a window can happen
to anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that,&rdquo; Chub mumbled, his eyes downcast.
&ldquo;How am I going to pay? I-I don&rsquo;t have hardly
any spending money. And I can&rsquo;t ask Mrs. Lornsdale
to help me. I wish I&rsquo;d never joined the Cubs!
Then I wouldn&rsquo;t be in this awful mess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, cut out that kind of talk!&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
not in any mess. It&rsquo;s not fair either, to blame the
Cubs for this. It was just an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean that about the Cubs. I&rsquo;ll get the
money somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it,&rdquo; Dan advised. &ldquo;It was as much my
fault as it was yours that the window was smashed.
I told you to throw the ball hard, didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And I was standing in front of the church window,
Chub. So it was more my fault than it was
yours. I&rsquo;ll see Old Terry first thing tomorrow and
settle for the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pay it all, you mean?&rdquo; Midge asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Dan replied. &ldquo;I have some money saved.
It won&rsquo;t strap me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though he spoke carelessly, the denner had
struggled inwardly before making his generous
offer. For weeks he had been hoarding every penny,
intending to buy a basketball of his own. Now he&rsquo;d
have to forget about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t pay for a window I broke,&rdquo; Chub
insisted, but he plainly was relieved by the offer.
&ldquo;I-I&rsquo;ll try to pay you back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just forget it,&rdquo; Dan advised. &ldquo;Set your mind on
those tests you have to pass for Cubs. Know the
Cub handclasp yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chub shook his head.</p>
<p>Dan showed him the grasp with the first finger
extended straight along the inside of the other
person&rsquo;s wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what WEBELOS means too,&rdquo; Chub
said eagerly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The letters WBL stand for Cub ranks,&rdquo; Dan explained.
&ldquo;Wolf-Bear-Lion. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll be loyal.&rsquo; Get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so. But what does the &lsquo;S&rsquo; stand for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scout. The letters WBLS form the skeleton or
framework of the Indian tribal name, Webelos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cubs are supposed to be cheerful, helpful and
friendly always,&rdquo; Midge declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave too,&rdquo; added Red significantly as he moved
toward the bushes to retrieve the lost basketball.</p>
<p>Chub flushed, knowing full well that reference
was being made to the jittery way he had talked
about ghosts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a lot to learn,&rdquo; he said soberly. &ldquo;I want
to be a Cub the worst way. I&rsquo;ll try awfully hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you will,&rdquo; Dan declared with a friendly
grin. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make it too. At first it seems as if there&rsquo;s
a lot to learn. Know the Law of the Pack yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so. But what is the Pack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee whiskers! You are dumb!&rdquo; Red snorted,
coming back with the basketball tucked under his
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re violating one of the Cub rules right now,&rdquo;
Dan informed Red. &ldquo;A Cub is supposed to be
courteous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, I didn&rsquo;t mean anything! I&rsquo;m sorry, Chub.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind being called dumb, because I am.
But I&rsquo;m catching on a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs warmed to the boy, liking the way he
admitted his shortcomings. He might be young, but
he was eager and willing, and that was what
counted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You asked about the Pack,&rdquo; Dan said, taking up
Chub&rsquo;s question. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an association of Dens. Every
month all the Den members have a big gathering
of the citywide Pack. Believe me, those are some
pow-wows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, don&rsquo;t you wish the Pack would pull off a
basketball tournament,&rdquo; remarked Red. &ldquo;Wonder if
Den 1 has a team?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t get &rsquo;em interested,&rdquo; Dan regretfully
reported. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re going out for swimming this
fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use having a Cub team unless we can
round up competition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find some,&rdquo; Dan promised. &ldquo;First, though,
we ought to get our own team better organized. We
can stand a lot of practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can say that again,&rdquo; Chips agreed, gazing
at the jagged hole in the window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>The unfortunate accident had somewhat dampened
the high spirits of the Cubs. Abruptly, Red
announced that it was time for him to go home.
His departure also was a signal for the others to
leave.</p>
<p>Dan walked with Chub, telling him again not to
worry about the smashed glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t cost much to repair the damage,&rdquo; he
declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see Old Terry about it right away. No
use waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; Chub offered. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t let you
take all the blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Treuhaft cottage had a deserted appearance
as the boys approached. Old Terry had abandoned
his fence building and all his tools had been put
away. Though Dan pounded repeatedly on the
door, there was no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s off somewhere,&rdquo; Dan commented. &ldquo;Oh, well,
no use waiting. I&rsquo;ll come back here tomorrow after
church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys parted, Chub returning to the widow&rsquo;s
home at the outskirts of Webster City.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>Dan sauntered on alone, enjoying the nice air
and thinking about the events of the day. He liked
Chub and intended to look out for him. All the same,
it struck him as odd that the boy never revealed
anything about himself. Why had Mr. Hatfield requested
that no questions be asked? Did he have
special information about Chub that he was keeping
to himself?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting as curious as an old tabby cat,&rdquo; Dan
chided himself. &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll have all I can do to look
after my own affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His way took him past the old church. Dan had
no intention of stopping. Nevertheless, he did glance
toward the belfry, visible through the half-naked
trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer about that tapping bell,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;I
know I heard it. Since it couldn&rsquo;t have been the
wind, a bird must have flown against the clapper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The explanation satisfied Dan for the moment,
and he smiled in relief. How naive Chub had been
to suggest a ghost! Not that the old decaying church
didn&rsquo;t have an eerie appearance with its dead vines
and look of utter desolation.</p>
<p>Bushes had overgrown nearly all of the church
walls. The mass of crimson and yellow leaves against
stone and brick made a pretty splash of color, Dan
thought. But Old Terry really should whack down
the brush a bit, even with winter coming on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s thoughts were roving, when suddenly his
attention focused upon a tall, mis-shapen evergreen
at the west side of the old building. He halted to
stare.</p>
<p>The little tree was moving jerkily, as if alive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the dickens?&rdquo; Dan muttered.</p>
<p>As he watched, a shadowy figure slithered from
behind the foliage and vanished toward the graveyard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">CHAPTER 4</span>
<br />PAYMENT REFUSED</h2>
<p>Dan stood very still for a moment, staring fixedly
at the place where the shadowy figure had disappeared.
He wasn&rsquo;t sure what he had seen, or for that
matter whether he had observed anything.</p>
<p>Had his approach frightened away someone who
had been loitering at the rear windows of the old
church? So far as he could see from the road, no
one now was lurking in the cemetery. However,
the tilted tombstones offered many hiding places.</p>
<p>Dan briefly considered ambling over to study the
layout but decided against it. The hour was late and
he was due home. Besides the old church stood in
an isolated area, easily accessible to tramps who
might come up the slope from the river area.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use asking for trouble,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Whoever
was prowling around, probably wasn&rsquo;t doing
any harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan waited a few minutes longer, thinking he
might again glimpse the elusive figure. Seeing no
one, he trudged on home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>Sunday was a pleasant, quiet day in the Carter
household. Dan attended church school in the morning
as was his usual custom.</p>
<p>After that came a big dinner, and then a half
hour spent with the funnies. Suddenly he dropped
the newspaper as if its pages were charged with
electricity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Dan?&rdquo; his Mother inquired from
across the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot something important. I&rsquo;ve got to rush
out to Terry Treuhaft&rsquo;s place right away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t it wait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan shook his head and explained about the
broken window. &ldquo;I promised the Cubs I&rsquo;d take care
of it first thing today, Mom. It sort of slipped my
mind. I&rsquo;ll go right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fished two precious dollar bills from his bank.
The window shouldn&rsquo;t cost half that much, he
hoped. But to be on the safe side, he would take an
extra dollar along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want your father to drive you to the
cottage?&rdquo; his mother questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind walking,&rdquo; Dan replied. &ldquo;See you
later.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<p>Leaves were falling fast, dotting walks and highway.
Dan shuffled through them, enjoying the soft
crackle underfoot. He sucked in a deep breath, and
then began to whistle because his spirits were high.</p>
<p>Terry Treuhaft was nowhere about when Dan
came to the cottage. He rapped on the door. The
knock was a bit more forceful than he had intended
it to be.</p>
<p>Almost at once the door was opened by a stout
woman in a checkered dress. Dan assumed she must
be Mrs. Treuhaft and he could guess by the expression
of her face that she was very annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; he apologized quickly. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean
to knock so hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Treuhaft did not smile or reply graciously
as he had expected her to do. Instead, she fixed him
with an unfriendly stare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she asked, not opening
the door very wide.</p>
<p>Dan explained that he had come to see Mr. Treuhaft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t here and won&rsquo;t be for awhile,&rdquo; the woman
answered shortly.</p>
<p>Dan reached for his pocketbook. &ldquo;I want to pay
for the window at the church,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you
think a dollar will be enough?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Church window?&rdquo; A strange light flickered in
Mrs. Treuhaft&rsquo;s steel gray eyes.</p>
<p>Dan started to tell her what had happened the
previous day, but she cut him short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think a dollar is enough to pay for the damage!
Well, the very idea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was only a small window,&rdquo; Dan said, startled
by the intensity of the woman&rsquo;s outburst. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll
pay whatever you think it will cost to replace the
glass. Two dollars maybe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two dollars! Why that wouldn&rsquo;t begin to do it.
The damage was enormous! Simply enormous! My
husband was furious when he learned of it. For your
information, he&rsquo;s talking to the church trustees about
it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan could not understand why such a fuss was
being made about a window pane. Hadn&rsquo;t he offered
to pay? Why, the incident was being blown
up out of all proportion!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a nerve coming here and offering me
a dollar!&rdquo; the woman went on angrily. &ldquo;But it proves
one thing. You admit you did the damage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, yes, we broke the window. It was an accident.
We were playing with a basketball and it
went wild, through the glass.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I want to know.&rdquo; The woman nodded
with grim satisfaction and closed the door in Dan&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>A moment later she flung it open again to add
severely: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear more about this later!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she closed the door again.</p>
<p>Puzzled by the woman&rsquo;s strange behavior, Dan
started slowly home. He was sorely troubled to
learn that the Treuhafts meant to make so much of
the accident. What sum, he wondered, could they
demand for a broken window? If two dollars wasn&rsquo;t
enough to pay for the glass, he&rsquo;d really have to dig
deep into his savings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, when I drove a baseball through Mrs.
Simpson&rsquo;s basement window last Spring she charged
me only seventy-five cents,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;I guess
a church window must be something special. But
that window wasn&rsquo;t stained glass&mdash;just ordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan decided not to tell Chub how much the mishap
was to cost. He was quite sure the new Cub had
little or no spending money, and couldn&rsquo;t be expected
to help out in any case. Anyway, he&rsquo;d offered
to pay for the damage. Since the money had been
refused, the next move would be up to Mr. Treuhaft.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>Monday night when Dan went to the church
gymnasium for basketball practice, he still was
brooding about the unfortunate accident. However,
he did not disturb the other boys by relating what
had happened. The Cubs tried free throws and
worked out a team play which didn&rsquo;t go too
smoothly.</p>
<p>Finally, everyone went upstairs for a special
meeting Mr. Hatfield had called. Though the business
session had been set for four-thirty sharp, the
leader had not yet arrived. This was unusual, for
Mr. Hatfield made a point of punctuality.</p>
<p>The boys talked over interesting places they had
thought up for the Den to visit. As time dragged
on and still Mr. Hatfield did not come, Brad tried
to keep the Cubs interested by discussing plans for
the Friday night party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone found an ice cream freezer yet?&rdquo; he
asked the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know there are a couple at the old church,&rdquo;
Midge finally said. &ldquo;We should be able to get those.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t count on it,&rdquo; Dan interposed. &ldquo;Old Terry
Treuhaft has it in for us. He&rsquo;s really steaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terry&rsquo;s down on the Cubs?&rdquo; Brad questioned in
surprise. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>The Cubs looked embarrassed, reluctant to explain.
When Brad pressed his inquiry, Chub stammered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&mdash;it was all my fault. I threw a basketball
through the church window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The blame was partly mine, and I&rsquo;m paying for
it,&rdquo; Dan said quickly. &ldquo;I went out to Treuhaft&rsquo;s place
yesterday. He wasn&rsquo;t there and his wife was pretty
snippy with me. So I figure we won&rsquo;t get those
freezers now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be others in Webster City. But we&rsquo;ll
have to hustle if we get them in time for Friday.
Guess I&rsquo;d better name a special committee to look
after the job and see that the ice cream is ready in
time for the party. Any volunteers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best,&rdquo; Dan offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! I&rsquo;ll appoint Chub, Red and Chips to help
you. Fred and Midge are to look up the matter of
getting ice and rock salt. Mrs. Holloway has promised
to help with the ice cream mixture. What
kind&rsquo;ll we have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tutti fruiti,&rdquo; piped up Chips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would think of something like that, you
drip!&rdquo; Midge accused. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re having something
simple like vanilla.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s compromise on strawberry,&rdquo; Brad suggested.
&ldquo;All in favor, say &lsquo;aye.&rsquo; Opposed? The ayes
have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time it was ten minutes to five, and the
Cubs began to shift uneasily in their chairs. Mr.
Hatfield never had been so late before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s been in an auto accident,&rdquo; Chips
began to speculate. &ldquo;Something has happened or
he&rsquo;d be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could telephone his house,&rdquo; Brad said reluctantly.</p>
<p>He was debating the matter when the Cubs
heard an outside church door open and close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is now,&rdquo; Brad exclaimed in relief.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield came into the meeting room, his gaze
sweeping the semi-circle of expectant Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to be late, boys.&rdquo; He spoke stiffly,
and in an oddly subdued tone of voice.</p>
<p>The Cubs knew instantly that something was
wrong. Mr. Hatfield didn&rsquo;t seem at all his usual
pleasant, easy-going self. His lips were drawn into
a tight line of disappointment and he was unsmiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thought something had happened to you,&rdquo;
Brad remarked. &ldquo;Shall we start the meeting with a
song or the pledge of allegiance?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s too late for a meeting now,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
replied. &ldquo;We have a very important matter to discuss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs became most attentive, aware that for
some reason the group had incurred the leader&rsquo;s displeasure.
As Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s gaze swept the semi-circle
it lingered for a moment on Dan. The boy
had an uncomfortable feeling that he was being
singled out for attention. Had Old Terry Treuhaft
complained about the window perhaps?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, I&rsquo;ve just come from an unpleasant meeting,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield said. &ldquo;I was on my way here when
I received a telephone call, asking me to stop at the
office of Richard W. Brady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lawyer?&rdquo; interposed Brad, recognizing the
name.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield nodded and went on: &ldquo;Mr. Brady
represents the trustees of the Christian Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan felt a cold lump come into his throat. So
his hunch had been right! Old Terry Treuhaft had
made trouble about the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had a most uncomfortable half hour,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield resumed. &ldquo;Mr. Brady has accused our organization
of some very dishonorable acts. To put
it concisely, he&rsquo;s threatening to sue for $20,000!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">CHAPTER 5</span>
<br />A THREATENING SUIT</h2>
<p>Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s blunt announcement electrified
the Cubs. For a moment no one spoke and then
there was a buzz of excited conversation. Everyone
talked at the same time, demanding details.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you very much,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield replied.
&ldquo;Mr. Brady said two of the church trustees came to
him this morning, asking that he place their complaint
before the Scout organization. The trustees
insist that Cub Scouts visited the church grounds
Saturday and did a great deal of damage. They
demand a settlement of their claim, or they&rsquo;ll sue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty thousand for a broken window?&rdquo; Dan
demanded. &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those old trustees are out of their heads!&rdquo; Red
added furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than a single window is involved,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield informed the Cubs. &ldquo;Statues were broken,
the attorney said, and at least three of the large
stained-glass windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s impossible!&rdquo; Dan cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We only broke one tiny little window,&rdquo; Red
added.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Start at the beginning and tell me everything,&rdquo;
Mr. Hatfield ordered. &ldquo;Who went out to the church
Saturday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I planned the hike,&rdquo; Dan confessed. &ldquo;Brad and
Fred couldn&rsquo;t go. Chips, Chub, Midge, Red and
myself were the only ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were after an ice cream freezer the attorney
said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. We asked Mr. Treuhaft if we could
borrow a couple that are stored in the basement.
He was busy and told us to come back later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After he turned you down, did you try to break
into the church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We certainly didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Dan denied indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We just ate lunch there and tossed my basketball
around a little while,&rdquo; Red contributed. &ldquo;Chub
made a bad throw and broke a window. That&rsquo;s all
there was to it, except that Dan said he&rsquo;d pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried,&rdquo; Dan took up the story. &ldquo;Yesterday I
went to Old Terry&rsquo;s place. He wasn&rsquo;t there, but
his wife refused the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has anyone returned to the church since the
group left there Saturday?&rdquo; the Cub leader inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went past once on my way from Mr. Treuhaft&rsquo;s
place,&rdquo; Dan answered. &ldquo;That was Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see anyone around the premises?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no.&rdquo; The questioned surprised Dan. &ldquo;No
person,&rdquo; he amended. &ldquo;I did see a sort of shadow
moving away toward the graveyard. It might have
been a person or an animal or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or a ghost?&rdquo; interposed Midge, half teasingly.</p>
<p>The other Cubs however, were in no mood for
his joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could the trustees threaten to sue for twenty
thousand dollars?&rdquo; Brad asked, deeply troubled.
&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s silly! Anyway, they haven&rsquo;t a chance of
collecting, because we don&rsquo;t have twenty dollars,
much less twenty thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re threatening to bring a court action
against the entire Scout organization,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
explained. &ldquo;The Scout treasury by coincidence has
almost exactly twenty thousand. The money is in
a special building fund.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Brady knew that!&rdquo; Dan exploded. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
why he&rsquo;s demanding so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; the Cubmaster agreed. &ldquo;But any way
we look at it, this is serious business. The honor of
our Den is at stake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can they blame us for something we didn&rsquo;t
do?&rdquo; Midge demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>Mr. Hatfield assured the Cubs that he believed
their story that only one window had been broken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m driving out to the church now to see for
myself how much damage has been done,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;Who wants to ride along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because it was nearing the dinner hour, only
Brad, Dan, Fred and Chips elected to go.</p>
<p>The sun was riding low in the sky by the time
the automobile reached the church grounds. Mr.
Hatfield parked along the main road, and the boys
walked up the broken front walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty thousand, of course, is a ridiculous figure
to demand,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield remarked, following the
Cubs. &ldquo;I doubt the property is worth much more
than that, including the land. The trustees have
been trying to sell it for nearly two years, and
haven&rsquo;t yet found a buyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they&rsquo;re taking it out on us!&rdquo; Chips said resentfully.</p>
<p>The walk curved and the Cubs obtained a clear
view of the old building. Dan, slightly ahead of the
others, halted abruptly, dismayed by what he saw.</p>
<p>Not one, but half a dozen small windows had
been smashed. The rainbow-hued glass of a circular,
stained window had been broken too.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Someone else did that!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;No wonder
the trustees are sore!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfair to blame the Cubs,&rdquo; Chips declared.</p>
<p>The boys circled the old church, noting evidence
of extensive damage. With so many windows smashed,
entry into the building itself could not be prevented.</p>
<p>Chips started to crawl through one of the larger
openings, but Mr. Hatfield hauled him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in deep enough now,&rdquo; he said severely.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t make it worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was well that Chips was prevented from crawling
through the window, for a few minutes later, an
automobile pulled up at the side entrance of the
building.</p>
<p>Terry Treuhaft and two men the Cubs did not
recognize, came over to the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The church trustees, I think,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield advised
in a whisper.</p>
<p>His guess was correct. The two elderly men
proved to be Elwin Maxwell and Joshia Brennan.
The newcomers spoke curtly to Mr. Hatfield and
ignored the Cubs completely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>Old Terry unlocked the front church door with a
massive key so that the trustees could enter. Though
not invited to do so, the Cubs followed close behind.</p>
<p>In the vestibule a marble statue lay smashed.
Plaster either had fallen of its own weight or had
been knocked in ugly patches from the walls. Pews
were overturned, a stair railing broken from its supports
and a stack of old hymn books scattered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see what they did!&rdquo; Old Terry said to the
two trustees. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been taking good care of this
place. Now look at it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had nothing to do with this,&rdquo; Dan said, trying
to draw the attention of the trustees. &ldquo;Absolutely
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These were the boys,&rdquo; Old Terry identified them
for his employers. &ldquo;They came out to my place to
demand the key so they could get an ice cream
freezer. When I denied it to &rsquo;em, they came here
just the same and broke in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We came here to eat our lunch on the grounds,&rdquo;
Dan replied, &ldquo;but we didn&rsquo;t break in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You admit you broke a window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One window. We didn&rsquo;t do all this damage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were seen breaking in,&rdquo; Old Terry insisted.
&ldquo;Some folks in the neighborhood saw your gang
climbing through the windows and called the police.
But you managed to get away before the wagon
came.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You must have dreamed all that!&rdquo; Chip gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time was this supposed to have happened?&rdquo;
Dan demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know well enough. Just about dusk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were home long before that,&rdquo; Chips retorted.
&ldquo;So your story doesn&rsquo;t hang together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield spoke quietly. &ldquo;The Cubs have told
me their version of what happened, and I believe it.
Den 2 boys are honorable and truthful. I&rsquo;m convinced
they&rsquo;re not responsible for this damage. Believe
me, if I thought otherwise, I&rsquo;d be the last to
defend them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have an opportunity to defend them in
court,&rdquo; Mr. Maxwell said acidly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care to discuss
this matter further. See our attorney, Mr.
Brady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield knew that it would be a waste of
breath to try to talk to the two trustees while they
were in their present mood. He motioned for the
Cubs to leave the church.</p>
<p>All filed out with exception of Brad, who had taken
no part in the conversation with the trustees.
He had busied himself at the rear of the church,
inspecting an overturned pew which had caught his
attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Coming, Brad?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be right with you,&rdquo; the Den Chief replied.</p>
<p>Even then he lingered for a moment. When finally
he came outside, he seemed very thoughtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Brad?&rdquo; Dan questioned him.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so quiet. You don&rsquo;t think we wrecked the
church do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re acting sort of queer. What kept you in
the church, Brad? You were looking at that bench
a long while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found something too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did?&rdquo; Dan became eager. &ldquo;What was it,
Brad? Anything that might help clear the Cubs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Brad replied slowly. &ldquo;It might not
have any significance, and then again, it could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you find?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll keep it under your hat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad lowered his voice. &ldquo;On that overturned pew
I noticed some freshly carved initials. They were
&lsquo;P. O.&rsquo; Does that mean anything to you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">CHAPTER 6</span>
<br />A CHALLENGE FROM PAT</h2>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;P. O.,&rsquo;&rdquo; Dan thoughtfully repeated the initials.
&ldquo;The only thing that pops into my mind is Post
Office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hardly what I meant,&rdquo; Brad replied, smiling.
&ldquo;The letters were freshly carved. I could tell
from the color of the wood. Besides, there were tiny
splinters on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan surged with excitement as he realized the
importance of the Den Chief&rsquo;s discovery. Since the
initials had been cut so recently, it must mean that
they had been carved by the person or persons who
had wrecked the church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know of only one person with the initials &lsquo;P.
O.&rsquo;,&rdquo; Brad said significantly. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you guess?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Pat Oswald?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else? Of course we have no proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat and his gang might have been here after the
Cubs left last Saturday! Say, that could have been
what happened! They wrecked the place and we
get blamed.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I figure it,&rdquo; Brad nodded. &ldquo;But
as I said, we have no proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s tell the trustees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s for Mr. Hatfield to decide, Dan. This accusation
against the Cubs is dead-serious business and
we can&rsquo;t make any false moves. If we&rsquo;d charge Pat
with this, we might be called on to prove our claims.
Could we do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we must keep a tight lip and see what
we can learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan knew that Brad&rsquo;s reasoning was sound.
Though they suspected Pat and the group of boys
he ran with, they certainly could not prove it. Inquiry
in the neighborhood, however, might bring to
light additional clues.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield, unaware of Brad&rsquo;s discovery, was
still talking to Old Terry and the trustees. His efforts
to convince them of the Cubs&rsquo; innocence was unavailing.
The only concession that the church officials
made was to agree that the Cubmaster might
appear before the entire church board the following
Wednesday.</p>
<p>Breaking off the conversation, the trustees drove
away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>Old Terry, left behind, began to assert his authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you boys get off this property!&rdquo; he directed.
&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you caused enough trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfair to accuse us!&rdquo; Chips said furiously.
&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t do the damage, and you should know
it! Cubs aren&rsquo;t hoodlums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wanted that freezer, and you didn&rsquo;t care
how many windows you smashed to get in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That just isn&rsquo;t so,&rdquo; Dan declared. &ldquo;We never did
get the freezers. Like enough they&rsquo;re still in the
basement. Have you looked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Chips demanded. &ldquo;I guess that
would prove&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t prove anything,&rdquo; the caretaker retorted,
locking the church door. &ldquo;Now begone, will
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, boys,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said quietly.
&ldquo;No use arguing about this affair. Everything will
be taken up at the meeting Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Decidedly downcast, the Cubs followed their
leader to the car. During the ride into Webster City,
they assured him repeatedly that they were innocent
of the charges against them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry
too much about it. I think&mdash;I hope at any rate&mdash;that
everything can be explained and adjusted. Unfortunately,
Elwin Maxwell is a very stubborn man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s chairman of the board too, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; Brad
recalled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I gather he is the one who is pressing the
suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even the thought of a twenty thousand dollar
claim filed against the Scout organization dismayed
the Cubs. If such action were taken, there would
be unpleasant newspaper publicity and court sessions.
The Cubs would be given a black-eye in the
community. Even if they later were cleared, they
might never completely live it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about the party for our folks Friday?&rdquo; Dan
presently asked. &ldquo;Now that we&rsquo;re in this mess, shall
we drop our plans?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely not, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far we haven&rsquo;t any ice cream freezers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get them somewhere. If necessary, we&rsquo;ll
buy ice cream at the drugstore. The party goes on
exactly as planned.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<p>The Cubs brightened at this decision and began
to discuss ways and means of clearing themselves of
the outrageous charge against them. Brad told of
the discovery he had made inside the church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat Oswald,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield mulled over the name.
&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of him. Brad, you may have hit
upon something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it will clear the Cubs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not, Brad. But at least it gives us a
starting point for our own investigation.&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
stopped the car for a traffic light. Shifting gears
to go on, he added: &ldquo;Now, we must say nothing
about finding the carved initials, boys. But see what
information you can pick up about Pat and his
gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat is known as a troublemaker,&rdquo; Chips declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need facts, not hearsay,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield reminded
the boys. &ldquo;By the way, when you fellows
were out at the church Saturday, you didn&rsquo;t notice
anyone loitering around?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not actually,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;Chub thought he saw
a ghost though. We rather made fun of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe what he saw was someone hiding in the
bushes,&rdquo; Brad pointed out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Dan agreed. He hadn&rsquo;t intended to
mention his own experience, but now decided to tell
about seeing the shadowy figure slithering toward
the graveyard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>He related the incident hesitantly, half expecting
the Cubs to tease him. No one did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obviously, you didn&rsquo;t see a ghost,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
commented. &ldquo;You probably caught a glimpse of one
of those hoodlums, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny thing though,&rdquo; Dan replied meditatively.
&ldquo;The shadow I saw didn&rsquo;t look like a boy ghost. The
figure was rather tall and thin. I had the queerest
feeling at the time, almost the same as I did today&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, &lsquo;as you did today?&rsquo;&rdquo; Brad
alertly tripped him up.</p>
<p>The remark had slipped from Dan unintentionally.
He certainly didn&rsquo;t want the Cubs to think
that he was jittery. Or that he was imagining things.
He remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, give!&rdquo; Brad commanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was nothing really.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did see someone again today at the church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Dan answered. &ldquo;It was just a feeling I had
while we were in the church. You&rsquo;ll laugh I know,
but I had the strangest feeling that we were being
watched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watched?&rdquo; said Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain it. As I said, it was just a feeling.
I&mdash;I felt as if everything we said and did inside
that building was being noted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was imagination, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
smiled. &ldquo;I can understand the feeling though. The
church interior was quiet and filled with strange
echoes. Don&rsquo;t give it too much thought Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feeling slightly rebuked, Dan made no mention
of the incident of the tapping bell. Nor did Chips
speak of it. Neither of them believed that there
were ghosts either at the old church or anywhere.</p>
<p>One by one the Club leader dropped the boys
off at their separate homes. He promised that the
moment he had anything to report about the church
matter, he would call a special meeting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Cubs continued to make plans
for the Friday night ice cream party. Search as they
would, however, they could not locate even a single
ice cream freezer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No hope of getting those two in the church basement
either,&rdquo; Dan gloomily remarked to Brad Tuesday
night after school. The two boys stood at a
street corner, books under their arms. &ldquo;For that
matter, I wouldn&rsquo;t even ask Old Terry to borrow
&rsquo;em now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d just turn us down,&rdquo; Brad agreed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>Unobserved by the two Cubs, Pat Oswald and a
companion had come up behind them. As Dan
turned he saw the pair and knew they deliberately
had been listening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that about Old Terry?&rdquo; Pat asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Dan replied shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I heard what you said. You want to borrow
an old ice cream freezer from him, and he won&rsquo;t
let you have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything wrong in wanting a freezer?&rdquo; Brad
asked pleasantly. &ldquo;Maybe you know where we can
get one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I do,&rdquo; Pat grinned. &ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t tell,
not in a million years. I&rsquo;d hate to be a Cub!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d hate to be one?&rdquo; Dan demanded. Pat&rsquo;s
manner irritated him. He disliked the older boy&rsquo;s
smug smile and attitude of knowing-it-all. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cubs are babies&mdash;little baby bears!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know anything about the organization!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I? Well, let me tell you a thing or two, Mr.
Danny Boy Carter, everyone in Webster City has
heard about the mess they&rsquo;re in now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan and Brad were chagrined by this thrust. So
the story had spread that church authorities had
threatened to sue!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs are sunk!&rdquo; Pat chortled. &ldquo;By the time
the court gets through, there won&rsquo;t be an organization
left. It will serve you right, too, for wrecking
the old church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t do it, and you know it,&rdquo; Dan retorted.
&ldquo;Say, weren&rsquo;t you and your gang out that way last
Saturday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says so?&rdquo; Pat returned, instantly on the
defensive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know plenty about what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only what I heard,&rdquo; Pat replied. His bluster had
faded away.</p>
<p>Dan was elated to note that his sharp question
had worried the other. He would have pursued the
matter further, but Pat and his friend moved off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You scored that time, Dan,&rdquo; Brad said when they
were alone again. &ldquo;All the same, go easy in talking
to him. If we&rsquo;re to learn anything, we mustn&rsquo;t give
away what we suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be more careful,&rdquo; Dan promised. &ldquo;Did you
notice how he acted when I suggested that he&rsquo;d
been around the church Saturday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did, Dan. Tomorrow night I&rsquo;m going out there
again, and canvass the neighborhood. It may be
that we can dig up someone who saw the damage
being done. In that case, the Cubs could be cleared.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pat and his gang were responsible, I&rsquo;ll bet on
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so myself,&rdquo; Brad agreed. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t forget,
we must prove any charges we make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the Webster City newspapers carried
only brief stories on the damage which had been
done at the Christian Church, word of it spread
very rapidly.</p>
<p>No mention had been made of the Cub organization
or the threatened law suit in either the Webster
City Herald or the Journal. Nevertheless, rumors
circulated that the boys of Den 2 were responsible
for the damage. The Cubs smarted under the humiliation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never live this down,&rdquo; Midge said morosely
the next afternoon as the Cubs waited in their clubroom.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield had called a special meeting and the
boys were expecting him at any moment. He came
in just then, so sober-faced that the Cubs instantly
knew bad news awaited them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just come from talking to the church trustees,&rdquo;
he reported after hanging up his hat on the
wall rack. &ldquo;Our meeting was to have been later, but
our lawyer arranged an earlier conference.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Our lawyer?&rdquo; Brad asked, startled. &ldquo;Do we have
one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Scout organization has obtained the services
of a very able attorney. We thought it best to employ
counsel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this accusation against us is really serious?&rdquo;
Brad questioned. The other Cubs, deeply worried,
had gathered about in a tight, tense little group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s serious,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield admitted drawing
a deep breath. &ldquo;As I started to tell you, our lawyer
and some of the Scout officials talked to the trustees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t they listen to reason?&rdquo; Red inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Several of the board members were inclined
to accept our word that the Cubs wouldn&rsquo;t and
couldn&rsquo;t have destroyed church property. Maxwell
wouldn&rsquo;t go along with the others. He&rsquo;s determined
to sue unless we pay for the damage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty thousand dollars,&rdquo; Chips muttered.
&ldquo;Why, that old wreck of a place isn&rsquo;t worth half
that amount!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it is, Chips. However, a damage claim
of twenty thousand is ridiculous. Mr. Maxwell himself
recognizes that, for he has offered to settle for
ten thousand if the organization pays within ten
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old skinflint!&rdquo; Red exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve refused,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield went on. &ldquo;The
next move is up to the trustees. All we can do is
wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that the Cub leader&rsquo;s report had been made,
the boys were in no mood for a long meeting. Brad
took up a few matters concerning the Friday party,
including the necessity for finding at least one ice
cream freezer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tomorrow is our last chance,&rdquo; he told the Cubs.
&ldquo;Everyone get busy. Ask friends and neighbors and
let&rsquo;s see if we can&rsquo;t find one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Brad ended his little pep talk, the boys were
startled to hear a loud pounding on the closed clubroom
door.</p>
<p>Chub and Dan both jumped up to see who had
rapped.</p>
<p>Dan reached the door first. No one was there.
He thought though, that he heard a muffled snicker,
and certainly he detected the sound of retreating
footsteps. As he listened a moment, he noticed a
folded piece of paper lying on the cement floor
almost at his feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Chub cried, seeing the paper at
the same instant.</p>
<p>Dan picked it up. He unfolded the coarse, soiled
sheet to discover a pencil-scrawled message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;THE CUBS ARE SISSIES,&rdquo; it read. &ldquo;WE CAN
LICK YOU IN BASKETBALL ANY OLD DAY.
HOW ABOUT A GAME? THIS IS A CHALLENGE.
LEAVE YOUR ANSWER IN A BOTTLE
IN HAGERMAN&rsquo;S ALLEY.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The note was signed &ldquo;Pat Oswald and the Purple
Five.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">CHAPTER 7</span>
<br />&ldquo;KNOW YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD&rdquo;</h2>
<p>As Dan read the note from Pat, the Cubs&rsquo; first reaction
was one of annoyance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the nerve of him!&rdquo; Fred Hatfield explained.
&ldquo;He sneaks up here, listening to our sessions, and
then leaves a cheap challenge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s write a hot note back, telling that Purple
Five to go jump in an ash can!&rdquo; Red proposed.</p>
<p>Dan and Brad dashed down the corridor to see
if they could intercept the intruders. However, Pat
and his followers had slipped out a side door and
were out of sight.</p>
<p>The two Cubs knew that it would be useless to
search the church yard, so rejoined the other boys
in the meeting room. By this time, argument over
the note had attained a high pitch.</p>
<p>Red, Fred and Chips were in favor of rejecting
the challenge in short order. Chub held no opinion
whatsoever. Midge was talking in favor of giving the
dare serious consideration.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we refuse to play, Pat will go all over town,
saying we&rsquo;re afraid to do it because we&rsquo;d be licked,&rdquo;
he argued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might at that,&rdquo; Brad interposed. &ldquo;Our team
isn&rsquo;t the smoothest on wheels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t practiced much, that&rsquo;s why,&rdquo; Midge
insisted. &ldquo;Why, we could beat Pat and his hoodlums
with our hands tied behind our backs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be too sure of it myself,&rdquo; Brad said
with an easy smile. &ldquo;From what I hear, Pat is a
first-rate athlete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw a sample of his basket shooting the
other day,&rdquo; Dan reminded the Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think that stupid Purple Five team could
beat us?&rdquo; Red demanded, leaping to his feet. &ldquo;Why,
that&rsquo;s downright disloyal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan hesitated to make his position clear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not saying any such thing, and I&rsquo;m not disloyal, Red.
Maybe our Cub team, disorganized as it is, could
beat the Purple Five. Then again, maybe we couldn&rsquo;t.
It might be an interesting match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if they should lick us?&rdquo; Chips asked uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a risk we&rsquo;d have to take,&rdquo; Brad answered.
&ldquo;Naturally, if we decide to play, we&rsquo;ll have to get
busy and practice.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>Mr. Hatfield had taken no part in the discussion,
and Dan now asked him what he thought of the
challenge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, let&rsquo;s hear your opinion, and then I&rsquo;ll speak
my piece,&rdquo; the Cub leader replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m in favor of picking up the challenge,&rdquo;
Dan replied after a moment of thought. &ldquo;For two
reasons. First, if we turn the game down, Pat and
his gang will go around saying we&rsquo;re afraid of defeat.
Then it hit me that if we really want to learn
more about those kids and their habits, this would
be a mighty good chance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a bunch of hoodlums!&rdquo; Red said resentfully.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably their fault that the Scout organization
is mixed up in a threatened lawsuit. They
slap us on one cheek and we hold up another for
a big whallop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We only suspect that Pat&rsquo;s outfit did the damage
at Christian Church,&rdquo; Brad said, supporting Dan&rsquo;s
position. &ldquo;If we schedule a game, we may overhear
talk that will give us a straight lead. What do you
think, Mr. Hatfield?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cubs are supposed to give good will,&rdquo; he replied
gravely. &ldquo;Pat and his gang haven&rsquo;t had many advantages.
Contact with a church, a worthwhile Cub organization
and wholesome sportsmanship, might
do the outfit a world of good.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, but what about us?&rdquo; Red argued. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t
they make more and more trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a possibility, Red. But I think the Cubs
can look after themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; declared Dan. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s arrange a game
and then get busy and practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An animated discussion followed as the boys
made their plans. Mr. Hatfield suggested that a
series of three games be scheduled in the church
gymnasium. He promised that they would be closely
supervised and rules strictly enforced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about charging admission?&rdquo; Brad suggested.
&ldquo;If the Cub organization has to pay for the
services of a lawyer, we should be getting some
money in our treasury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a general rule, Mr. Hatfield did not favor selling
tickets or charging admission for Cub affairs.
Nevertheless, he acknowledged that the Den&rsquo;s need
for cash was urgent and that a few extra dollars
might be of great help.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might charge a small amount,&rdquo; he agreed
reluctantly. &ldquo;Twenty-five cents perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>Only the date for the first game remained to be
settled. Mr. Hatfield said he thought it should be
set for at least ten days ahead to give the Cubs time
to practice and better organize their team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t devote all our time to athletics,&rdquo; he
warned the boys. &ldquo;Remember, we have those &lsquo;Know
Your Neighborhood&rsquo; visits ahead, not to mention
the party for parents. Speaking of the party, I&rsquo;m
ashamed to say I&rsquo;ve been so busy with conferences,
I&rsquo;ve had no chance to try to look up ice cream
freezers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one can find any,&rdquo; Midge reported gloomily.
&ldquo;That party will be one big flop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield cheered him. &ldquo;I think
that it might be well to postpone the affair one
week. Another seven days will give us time enough
to round up a freezer or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs were relieved by the change in plan,
especially as everyone was in an uneasy mood regarding
the outcome of the threatened lawsuit.
After electing Dan captain of the basketball team,
they assigned him and Brad to notify Pat Oswald
that the challenge had been accepted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too silly, leaving a note in a bottle in an
alley,&rdquo; Brad objected. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we just write
an acceptance and mail it to his home.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<p>The latter course was decided upon, and later
that night the two boys composed the letter and
sent it off. Two days later a message was returned
to the church clubroom, accepting the first basketball
game date and agreeing to the series of three
contests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deal is on, and now we&rsquo;ve got to buckle
down,&rdquo; Dan warned his teammates. &ldquo;Gobs of practice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Determined not to be shown up by the Purple
Five, the Cubs spent every spare hour in the church
gymnasium.</p>
<p>Gradually, under the coaching of Brad, the team
began to shape up. Dan and Midge, having the best
eye for basket shooting, were assigned as forwards.
Red and Chips, both being sturdily built, were to
guard. Brad would play center, as he had a long
reach, and was taller than any of the younger boys.</p>
<p>Chub and Fred were assigned as substitutes.
Neither was very adept at handling a basketball.
Both attended practice sessions faithfully, but Fred
in particular had no deep interest in the game, preferring
to read.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>Mr. Hatfield attended the work-outs whenever
he could. He was very busy, however, and frequently
was summoned to special meetings with
Scout leaders, court officials and attorneys. That the
Cubmaster was deeply worried over the pending
lawsuit was obvious from his preoccupied manner.</p>
<p>Though basketball had become an absorbing interest,
Brad and Dan did not neglect other Cub activities.
They made plans for &ldquo;Know Your Neighborhood&rdquo;
visits, and launched the building of a
cardboard fort in the clubroom. Fred enthusiastically
took charge of the work, gathering materials
and supervising the construction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re pretty well set for our Mom&rsquo;s and Dad&rsquo;s
party, if only we had an ice cream freezer,&rdquo; Dan remarked
one afternoon. &ldquo;Mr. Hatfield intended to
find one, but he&rsquo;s been too busy to give it any
thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try to rustle it ourselves,&rdquo; Brad proposed.
&ldquo;How about a house to house canvas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve already tried almost every home in our
block.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could work a new neighborhood, Dan. How
about the locality of Old Christian Church?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why there, Brad?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Thought we could do a little investigating at the
same time. On the pretext of asking for an ice cream
freezer, we can question folks in the neighborhood
about whether or not there were any witnesses to
the damage that was done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bad idea,&rdquo; Dan approved.</p>
<p>The boys hiked to within a block of the old
church and then began ringing doorbells. At each
house they voiced a double inquiry. First they asked
if an old fashioned ice cream freezer could be borrowed,
and then they inquired for information regarding
the recent trouble at the deserted building.</p>
<p>After nearly twenty unfruitful calls, Dan and
Brad began to grow discouraged. No one it seemed
had an ice cream freezer, and the only comment
they obtained relative to the church damage was
that &ldquo;a group of Boy Scouts did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No witnesses apparently,&rdquo; Brad said, losing
heart. &ldquo;It begins to look mighty bad for Den 2,
Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try one more house,&rdquo; Dan suggested.</p>
<p>The one he indicated stood directly across from
the abandoned church. Purposely, the boys had left
it to the last, so that their tour would end near a bus
stop.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>Going up the winding walk, Dan and Brad rapped
on the door. A man in shirt-sleeves, a newspaper
in his hand, came to the door. The two boys
repeated their inquiries which by now had become
a routine speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where you can find an ice cream
freezer,&rdquo; the man turned them down. He stared at
the blue uniforms which the boys wore. &ldquo;Say, you
boys are Cub Scouts, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we are,&rdquo; Dan replied proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you in the gang that was supposed to have
ripped the church building apart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were not,&rdquo; Dan returned. &ldquo;Our organization
has been falsely accused. We&rsquo;re trying to prove we
had nothing to do with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so easy. You see, a few of us visited the
grounds before the real damage was done. We accidentally
smashed a window. After we left, the place
was wrecked, and we were accused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened just after dark,&rdquo; the home owner
said. &ldquo;I know because I heard windows being
smashed. A half dozen kids, more or less, were in
the gang, running wild over the place. I called
police, but they got away before the wagon arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see any of the boys?&rdquo; Brad asked
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only at a distance.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t see anyone in Cub uniforms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was too far away to tell. The boys mostly were
large fellows. Too old to be Cubs, I&rsquo;d judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad and Dan asked the man for his name and
address, intending to give it to Mr. Hatfield. If
their case actually came to trial it might be that he
could be called to testify in behalf of the Cubs. His
information, though, was meager.</p>
<p>After leaving the house, the two boys went across
the street to peer at the church building again. Since
their last visit, all the windows had been repaired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not too much damage has been done.&rdquo; Brad
said, gazing about. &ldquo;Those trustees are just trying to
build up a big case without much to go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan pressed his face against a basement window,
peering down into the storage room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those freezers are still there,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;I sure wish we could borrow &rsquo;em for the party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Brad returned. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
ask those trustees for a favor, even if we never find
a freezer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here either,&rdquo; Dan agreed. &ldquo;Say, I see our bus
coming. Let&rsquo;s grab it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>During the next two days, the Cubs were kept
very busy at school. Each afternoon was spent in
the gymnasium. On several occasions, they saw
members of Pat&rsquo;s crowd watching from the windows.
The boys never would come inside, but plainly
were studying the game and tactics of the Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re trying to study out our plays,&rdquo; Dan reported
to his teammates. &ldquo;Well, let &rsquo;em. We&rsquo;ll beat
them fair and square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Saturday morning, Mr. Hatfield took all Den
members to Juvenile Court on the first visit scheduled
in the &ldquo;Know Your Neighborhood&rdquo; series of
excursions.</p>
<p>The boys watched a hearing in progress, listened
to a little talk on traffic safety, and then met a judge.</p>
<p>Later, they crossed a corridor to another cluster
of offices. Mr. Hatfield explained that private hearings
were conducted for boys and girls who had
committed misdemeanors. He led the Cubs into the
office of Harold Greene, court director.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, I want you to meet an old friend of mine,&rdquo;
he introduced them.</p>
<p>The Cubs were grateful that the Juvenile Court
official made no reference whatsoever to the incident
involving the old Christian Church. He knew
about it, they were certain, but purposely was being
tactful.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>Mr. Greene shook hands which each Cub in turn.
When he came to Chub, he nodded and smiled and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Chub, I&rsquo;m glad to see you again. Getting
along fine, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Chub mumbled nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like the place where you are living now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y-yes, sir,&rdquo; Chub muttered again. He seemed
very ill at ease and acted relieved when Mr. Hatfield
steered the boys on to another office.</p>
<p>The Cubs could not fail to note that Chub was
well known to the Court director. Was it possible,
they speculated, that at some time he had been before
the court? Could that explain why Mr. Hatfield
had warned them not to inquire into the boy&rsquo;s past?</p>
<p>The Cubs moved on to a public reception room
where juveniles sat while awaiting calls to the conference
chambers. Glancing carelessly over the
group of downcast boys slouched in the chairs,
Dan received another shock.</p>
<p>There in one of the chairs by the door, sat Pat
Oswald! Seeing the Cubs, he quickly lowered his
head into a magazine and pretended to read.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHAPTER 8</span>
<br />A WISH FULFILLED</h2>
<p>Knowing that he had been recognized, Pat grinned
sheepishly at Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here with a friend of mine,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;These birds haven&rsquo;t got anything on me&mdash;no sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan had his own idea of why Pat might be in
court, but he pretended to accept the explanation.
He had heard at school that a group of boys had
been loitering near the railroad tracks, boarding
freight trains, and otherwise making a nuisance of
themselves. Undoubtedly, Pat and some of his cronies
had been brought in by police for questioning.</p>
<p>This was confirmed a moment later as one of the
court referees came out of his private office and
motioned to Pat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll talk to you next,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat cast a quick look at Dan, and ducked into the
conference room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>The tour of the big courthouse continued. Dan
could not fail to note that Chub seemed rather
familiar with the Juvenile Court section of the building.
More than ever he was convinced that the new
Cub member was known to some of the referees as
well as the court director. Chub, however, maintained
his usual shy silence and offered no explanation.</p>
<p>The boy&rsquo;s familiarity with the building did not
escape the attention of the other Cubs. As they
were leaving after the tour, Red sidled over to Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think about Chub?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice how the court director knew
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, but what of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&rdquo; Red was rather ashamed of his own
suspicions. &ldquo;I just wonder if maybe he hasn&rsquo;t been
in some trouble&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do too much speculating,&rdquo; Dan said
to end the talk. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like Chub?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No buts then, Red. Mr. Hatfield told us Chub
was okay, and that&rsquo;s enough for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; Red shrugged. &ldquo;I was just thinking,
that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>During the next few days the Cubs devoted many
hours to basketball practice. When not otherwise occupied
they worked on the cardboard fort in the
meeting room and perfected plans for the coming
Friday night party.</p>
<p>The problem of finding an ice cream freezer still
confronted the Cubs. On Thursday, only a day before
the scheduled affair to honor parents, the boys
admitted that they were up against it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to buy our ice cream,&rdquo; Brad said to
the Den members as they sat discussing the matter
in their clubroom. &ldquo;Mr. Hatfield has been too busy
to do anything about finding a freezer, and the rest
of us have had no luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The party won&rsquo;t be any good without homemade
ice cream,&rdquo; Midge said gloomily. &ldquo;I wanted to turn
the freezer too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use moaning about it,&rdquo; Brad replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have a good party just the same. At any rate we&rsquo;ll
have the big fort on display. Fred and his helpers
did a fine job building it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Fred said, warming to the praise. &ldquo;It
was a lot of work making the thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fort, constructed of cut and painted sheets
of cardboard, was a replica of an old pioneer historical
building which the boys had visited several
months before. Fred had spent weeks on the task,
working out every detail with care. Now the structure
was finished, ready for display at the Friday
party.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, there&rsquo;s one business matter to come
before the group,&rdquo; Brad resumed. &ldquo;We have a request
to consider from Pat Oswald.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wants to cancel the game!&rdquo; Chips guessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite the contrary. He and his boys are taking
the tournament very seriously. Pat demands a
chance to practice in our gymnasium before the
game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A silence fell upon the room. Then Red said
grumpily: &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;d like to have us turn over the
whole place to him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The request seemed like a reasonable one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan spoke up. &ldquo;I think we should agree to let
them use the gym. That is, if Mr. Hatfield says it is
all right. The church gym wasn&rsquo;t built for our special
use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat doesn&rsquo;t go to this church,&rdquo; Red growled. &ldquo;He
doesn&rsquo;t attend any church. Do him good if he did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cubs are supposed to be FAIR,&rdquo; Dan reminded
him. &ldquo;We agreed to a series of three games. Now
do we want it to be an honest test of athletic skill,
or do we want to win at any cost?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, let &rsquo;em use the gym,&rdquo; Red gave in, knowing
all the other Cubs favored Brad&rsquo;s viewpoint. &ldquo;Someone
ought to keep watch though, while they&rsquo;re here.
They might decide to wreck the place, the way they
did the old church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That hasn&rsquo;t been proven,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;Anyway,
you may be sure adults will supervise the practice
closely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chub, who had been seated nearest the door,
suddenly jumped up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Midge asked him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re as
nervous as a cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I thought I heard someone in the hall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s Mr. Hatfield coming,&rdquo; Brad said,
glancing at the wall clock. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a tiny bit late again.
Probably another meeting with Mr. Maxwell&rsquo;s lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs waited a moment, listening. Mr. Hatfield
did not appear, but Dan thought he heard an
outside door softly close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Pat and his gang have been eavesdropping
again!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>The Cubs ran out into the shadowy corridor. It
was quite deserted. But there against the wall,
neatly positioned like twin sentinels, were two large
ice cream freezers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Whoopee!&rdquo; chortled Midge. &ldquo;See what Santa
Claus brought us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freezers!&rdquo; Chips laughed, cavorting around
them. &ldquo;Just when we had given up hope too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the other Cubs were examining the mysterious
gifts, Dan and Brad hastened on to the outer
door.</p>
<p>They reached it in time to catch a fleeting glimpse
of someone vanishing into a clump of bushes to the
left of the churchyard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t Mr. Hatfield, was it?&rdquo; Dan demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too tall,&rdquo; Brad replied. &ldquo;Anyway, he wouldn&rsquo;t
have left the freezers in the hallway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was one of the Den Dads. Odd though,
that whoever it was, didn&rsquo;t rap on the clubroom
door and wait to be thanked. Anyway, I&rsquo;m sure
glad to get those freezers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad kept frowning thoughtfully as he walked
back to rejoin the other Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything to show who left the freezers?&rdquo; he
asked Midge. &ldquo;Any card?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing. They&rsquo;re big ones though. Just what
we need for our party tomorrow night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>Dan too had been inspecting the freezers. He
remarked that they were the same size as the ones
he had noticed in the old Christian Church basement.
&ldquo;Do you suppose they came from there?&rdquo; he
speculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it,&rdquo; Midge answered carelessly. &ldquo;Those
old trustees haven&rsquo;t relented one bit. And Terry
wouldn&rsquo;t bring them to us&mdash;you know that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we have &rsquo;em and that&rsquo;s what counts,&rdquo;
Chips cheerfully declared. &ldquo;Now we can go ahead
with our plans. Let&rsquo;s make the ice cream first thing
after school tomorrow night. It should keep if we
pack it in ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jubilantly, the Cubs carried the two freezers into
the clubroom. They were still discussing the strange
manner of delivery when Mr. Hatfield arrived. He
had nothing new to report regarding the threatened
damage suit, but expressed amazement that the
Den had acquired the cream freezers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had nothing to do with it,&rdquo; he assured the
Cubs. &ldquo;To be sure, I&rsquo;ve asked a number of people
if they knew where we could get some freezers.
Perhaps one of our inquiries paid off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad told the Cubmaster of the request Pat Oswald
had made with reference to use of the gymnasium
for a basketball practice session.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No reason why they can&rsquo;t use it for an hour tomorrow
night after school, is there?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
inquired. &ldquo;The Cubs will be making ice cream and
won&rsquo;t want the floor themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they should be allowed the run of
the place?&rdquo; Red protested. &ldquo;You know how Pat and
his gang are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The practice will be a supervised one. I promise
you that,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said. &ldquo;I see no reason why
the boys shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed privileges here, providing
they don&rsquo;t abuse them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re forgetting how they got us into trouble,&rdquo;
Red asserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Red. I just believe in fair play, that&rsquo;s all. We
agreed to the series of games, so it&rsquo;s only right that
we give the Purple Five a chance to practice. Right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess so,&rdquo; Red submitted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trust
Pat, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Word was carried to Pat that his team might use
the gymnasium the following afternoon from three-thirty
until four-thirty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean it?&rdquo; The boy demanded in surprise
when Dan gave him the information. &ldquo;Well,
thanks!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Say, by the way, you weren&rsquo;t at the church a
while ago, were you?&rdquo; Dan asked in an offhand
way.</p>
<p>The moment he had asked the question, he regretted
it. Once the words had been spoken it was
too late to retract them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, why?&rdquo; Pat demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a couple of ice cream freezers were delivered
to the Cubs,&rdquo; Dan explained reluctantly. &ldquo;I thought
you might know something about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat&rsquo;s blank expression convinced Dan that he
knew nothing of the matter. More than ever, he
was sorry he had brought up the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the Cubs doing with ice cream freezers?&rdquo;
Pat demanded, his curiosity aroused. &ldquo;For
that party you&rsquo;re giving tomorrow night, I bet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan had not suspected that the other knew of the
planned social affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you find out about it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Pat grinned provokingly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for me to know
and you to find out!&rdquo; he retorted.</p>
<p>Thrusting hands deep into the pockets of his
patched jeans, he sauntered off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">CHAPTER 9</span>
<br />STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Keep turning that crank! Do you want the paddles
to stick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The irate command was directed by Red Suell at
Chips who had rested a moment as he cranked one
of the big ice cream freezers.</p>
<p>All of the Cubs except Brad were making ice
cream in the church basement. Mrs. Holloway and
Red&rsquo;s mother had volunteered to direct the work.
The two mothers had been kept busy offering suggestions,
for none of the boys ever before had made
ice cream except in the tray of a refrigerator.</p>
<p>Dan and Midge had cracked the ice in a gunny
sack, hammering the stubborn chunks until they
were of tiny, uniform size. The metal containers,
with their wooden paddles, had been set into the
packed freezers, and now the cranking had begun.
Red was assigned to one, while Chub and Chips
took turns at the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My arm is getting tired,&rdquo; Red complained.
&ldquo;Someone else take over!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hardly been at it two minutes,&rdquo; Dan
teased. Nevertheless, he seized the crank, turning
it steadily and smoothly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, it&rsquo;s going harder and harder,&rdquo; he presently
admitted. &ldquo;Do you suppose the cream could be
frozen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very nearly so,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Holloway, packing
more ice into the freezer.</p>
<p>Dan kept cranking. Melted salt water spilled
faster and faster out of the little round hole in the
freezer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is getting awfully hard!&rdquo; he gasped, exerting
all of his strength to keep the crank moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this old freezer is stuck!&rdquo; cried Chips, who
was taking his turn at the other freezer. &ldquo;It won&rsquo;t
budge an inch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we take a look?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Holloway, relieving
him.</p>
<p>She unfastened the top of the freezer, carefully
opening the metal cylinder packed deep in ice.
The Cubs clustered around, eager to see what their
labors had produced.</p>
<p>Mrs. Holloway lifted the paddle slightly. The
Cubs uttered squeals of delight. The wooden paddle
was simply loaded with rich looking, delicately pink
strawberry ice cream.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It looks lovely, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Mrs. Holloway
laughed. &ldquo;Now you boys must draw straws to see
who gets to lick the paddle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chub won, so Mrs. Holloway handed the richly
coated paddle to him on a paper plate. Midge was
awarded the paddle from the freezer Dan had
turned so faithfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, is this ever good!&rdquo; he shouted, smacking
his lips. &ldquo;I wish I could have a big dish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can tonight,&rdquo; Mrs. Holloway promised.</p>
<p>The other Cubs looked so downcast to see Midge
and Chub eating the ice cream that Mrs. Holloway
gave them each a tiny sample.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best ice cream I ever tasted,&rdquo; declared Dan.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet our party will be a huge success tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the direction of the two mothers, the Cubs
cleaned up the muss they had made in the basement.
Both freezers then were packed firmly with
chopped ice, so that the cream would remain solid
until it was needed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, I wish you and Red would help carry the
freezers upstairs,&rdquo; Mrs. Holloway requested. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
so warm here, the ice will melt. I think it will be
better to set the freezers outside.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>The two Cubs followed instructions, setting the
containers on a tiny, back porch behind the church
kitchen. To further protect them, they covered both
freezers with a piece of canvas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything&rsquo;s set now for the party,&rdquo; Dan remarked
cheerfully. &ldquo;Wonder what&rsquo;s doing in the
gym?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moving down the corridor, the two Cubs could
hear the slap-slap-slap of rubber-soled shoes on the
polished gymnasium floor. Brad, Mr. Hatfield and
the other Cubs were there, watching the workout
of the Purple Five.</p>
<p>Obviously, Pat and his players were trying to put
on a show. They made a great commotion, passing
the ball fast, executing rapid turns and pivots and
taking long shots at the baskets. In a surprising
number of instances, the ball found its mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, they&rsquo;re plenty good,&rdquo; Dan admitted in a
whisper. &ldquo;Especially Pat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Watch &rsquo;em guard,&rdquo; Red replied, looking worried.
&ldquo;Rough as all get-out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield too, had observed the rough manner
in which the boys played. As the practice session
wound up, he remarked to Pat that it might be
well for the Purple Five to study the rules before
the first scheduled game.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We play strictly according to the book,&rdquo; he
warned. &ldquo;Any unnecessary roughness will go down
as a foul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to worry about our team,&rdquo; Pat
replied boastfully. &ldquo;We know the rules from Z to A.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After ending the practice the Bay Shore boys
took their time in leaving the church. They roved
the corridors, peered down into the basement, and
even into the Cub&rsquo;s private clubroom.</p>
<p>One of the boys spied the cardboard fort which
Fred had built. &ldquo;Gee! Will you look at the playhouse!&rdquo;
he shouted.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield shooed the five wanderers out of the
building. On the steps, Pat noticed the two ice
cream freezers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When do we eat?&rdquo; he demanded boisterously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Chips told him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s for our party
tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is invited?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only the parents of the Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, have a good time,&rdquo; Pat said with a grin.
&ldquo;See you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He peered again at the ice cream freezers, helped
himself to a chunk of ice, and sauntered off.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>The party that night began early. Soon after seven
o&rsquo;clock, the parents started to arrive. Dan, Fred and
Chub were on the welcoming committee to greet
everyone at the door. The other Cubs were stationed
at various tables, ready to explain the various
exhibits.</p>
<p>The fort which Fred had constructed drew a
great deal of favorable comment. Several parents
expressed the hope that the structure would be
kept on display for a long while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we intend to use it,&rdquo; Fred assured the group
of admirers. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll play Indian games and act out
pioneer stuff. Maybe put on a little play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs were a bit impatient for the singing,
the promotion ceremonies and other events to end.
Eyeing the array of chocolate, angel food and spice
cakes on the long supper table, they scarcely could
wait until the moment came to eat.</p>
<p>Dan noticed that Chub seemed rather downcast.
Sidling over to the younger boy, he asked him what
was wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Chub mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not having a good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; Chub insisted. &ldquo;Wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you don&rsquo;t act like it. Your face is as long
as a roller towel. What&rsquo;s eating you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Chub said again. And then he went
on hurriedly: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only that&mdash;that all the other
Cubs have a mother and Dad here tonight. I&rsquo;m all
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I know how you feel.&rdquo; Dan clumsily flung
an arm around the younger boy&rsquo;s shoulders. &ldquo;But
don&rsquo;t you care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He very much wanted to ask Chub about his
mother and father. But recalling Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s advice
not to ask questions, he remained silent.</p>
<p>Presently, Mrs. Hatfield announced that supper
would be served. The parents lined up for their decorated
paper plates, napkins, silverware and big
piece of homemade cake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be ready to dish up the ice cream in a
minute,&rdquo; Mrs. Hatfield advised Dan and Brad. &ldquo;Will
you boys please fetch the freezers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure thing,&rdquo; Dan said eagerly.</p>
<p>He and Brad, together with Red who wanted to
help, went out on the porch for the canvas-covered
freezers.</p>
<p>Looking about, they could not see the containers
anywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what became of &rsquo;em?&rdquo; Dan demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the canvas,&rdquo; Red noted. He pointed
to the covering which lay in a heap on the ground
near the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose Mr. Hatfield moved them?&rdquo;
Brad speculated. &ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rushed back into the church, to return a moment
later with the Cub leader. Mr. Hatfield assured
the boys that he had not touched either of the
freezers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I came this way about thirty minutes ago,
both were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then someone has taken them!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who would do such a mean thing?&rdquo; Red demanded.
&ldquo;Our party is ruined!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Word spread like wildfire that the ice cream had
been stolen. The other Cubs and some of the parents
came out of the church to see for themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I bet I know who took those freezers!&rdquo;
Chips cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; the others demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat Oswald and his gang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hardly fair to accuse them just because they
used the gymnasium today,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said rather
mildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat knew about the freezers,&rdquo; Chips insisted.
&ldquo;He saw them here on the steps, and he asked about
the party.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<p>Brad, with a pocket flashlight, had been examining
the soft earth near the church steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found a lot of shoe marks,&rdquo; he called the
attention of the Cubs to them. &ldquo;Boys tracks, I&rsquo;d
judge by their size. Have you fellows been tramping
around here today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t been off the walk or the porch,&rdquo; Dan
said, and most of the Cubs gave a similar reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, a gang of kids must have been here then,&rdquo;
Brad declared. &ldquo;See the tracks lead toward the
hedge. Here, you can tell that something heavy
was dragged over the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was Pat and his gang!&rdquo; Fred exclaimed.
&ldquo;Of all the mean ingratitude! We let &rsquo;em use our
gym and equipment, and they repay us by stealing
our ice cream!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We worked so hard to make it too!&rdquo; Red added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to call off our basketball games with
&rsquo;em&mdash;that&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; Midge said indignantly.</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield reminded the Cubs that they had no
proof that the ice cream actually had been taken by
Pat and his cronies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks highly suspicious,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m
in favor of giving the other fellow the benefit of the
doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>Several of the Den Dads toured the church yard,
in search of the culprits. They returned to report no
sign of the freezers, or the persons who had taken
them. Evidently the theft had been accomplished
nearly a half hour earlier, or at least long before the
discovery of the loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No chance of catching anyone now,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said regretfully. &ldquo;We may as well forget about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forget it?&rdquo; Midge wailed. &ldquo;After all the work we
did?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you never tasted such wonderful ice cream,&rdquo;
Chips went on. &ldquo;We only had tiny samples this afternoon.
We were looking forward to big dishes tonight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make ice cream another time,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
promised the Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we, without freezers?&rdquo; Dan asked. &ldquo;The
only ones we know about are at the old Christian
Church. No chance of getting those.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about the ones that were stolen?&rdquo; Brad
asked, rather worried. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t even know to
whom they belong.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>The Cubs had inquired among the parents, but
no one had admitted providing the two freezers.
Even Mr. Hatfield was somewhat uneasy to think
that later on, the unknown giver might call at the
church to ask the return of his or her property.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very strange about those freezers&mdash;&rdquo; he
mused. &ldquo;Very strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Disconsolately, the Cubs trooped back into the
church. They were resigned to a party without ice
cream.</p>
<p>However, Midge&rsquo;s father had slipped away to
the drugstore without consulting anyone. Even before
all the cake had been served, he was back with
several large packages of ice cream. He also had
bought some excellent strawberry topping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now this isn&rsquo;t as good as homemade ice cream,&rdquo;
he apologized. &ldquo;On short notice though, it was the
best substitute I could find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs ate their share of the ice cream and
after a while tended to forget the injustice that had
been done them. It relieved their minds to see that
the parents didn&rsquo;t seem to mind not having homemade
ice cream. Despite the theft of the freezers,
the party had been a great success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now before we break up for the evening, I suggest
we give the Cubs a big vote of thanks,&rdquo; proposed
Mr. Holloway. &ldquo;All in favor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>No one ever had an opportunity to join in the
vote of appreciation. For at that moment there
came a rap on the clubroom door.</p>
<p>Before anyone could open it, Terry Treuhaft
stepped into the room. The old caretaker&rsquo;s unexpected
arrival startled everyone. No one could imagine
what had brought him to the church uninvited.</p>
<p>Terry did not long leave the matter in doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come for my freezers,&rdquo; he said and his voice
fairly dripped icicles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;YOUR freezers?&rdquo; Red echoed. &ldquo;Oh m&rsquo;gosh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you must be mistaken about us having
your freezers,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t any freezers at all,&rdquo; declared Chips,
rather enjoying the joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand you do have the ones that were
at the church,&rdquo; the old caretaker said stiffly. &ldquo;I
was tipped that I&rsquo;d find them here. Where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look around if you like,&rdquo; Brad invited. &ldquo;If you
can find them, you&rsquo;re better at hunting than we
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of your sass, young man or I&rsquo;ll have the
law on you,&rdquo; Old Terry retorted. He felt ill at ease
with so many parents gazing steadily at him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Brad apologized. &ldquo;I did not intend
to be impolite. I merely meant to emphasize that
we do not have your freezers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did have them then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield admitted. &ldquo;We did
have a couple of ice cream freezers which were
stolen earlier tonight. However, I certainly had no
suspicion that they belonged to the Christian
Church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you know now,&rdquo; Old Terry retorted.
&ldquo;These Cubs, were after those freezers from the
first, and that was what caused &rsquo;em to break in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a minute,&rdquo; interposed Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;The
Cubs did not break into the Church. Of that I&rsquo;m
satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be satisfied, but the trustees aren&rsquo;t! The
Cubs will have to pay for the damage they did.
Besides, I want those two freezers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t a freezer on the premises,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said again.</p>
<p>Wearily, he told the caretaker what had happened.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re handing me a line about not knowing
where those freezers came from,&rdquo; Old Terry
growled. &ldquo;For that matter, how do I know they
aren&rsquo;t here somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may look around, if you like,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
invited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, I&rsquo;ll do that,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>Old Terry inspected the clubroom and then to
the deepening annoyance of the Cubs and their
parents, went down into the basement. Finally, he
seemed satisfied that the missing freezers were not
in the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Treuhaft, won&rsquo;t you have some cake and a
dish of store ice cream?&rdquo; Midge&rsquo;s mother invited
graciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Ma&rsquo;am, I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he declined the invitation.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m leaving now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stomped out, allowing the door to bang behind
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good riddance,&rdquo; Red exclaimed.</p>
<p>The Cubs began to straighten the clubroom, preparatory
to leaving. Everyone was tired and a little
discouraged even though the party had been a
success.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Old Terry spoiled everything,&rdquo; Dan said, expressing
the sentiment of his Cubmates. &ldquo;Do you suppose
he could have been right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About those stolen freezers belonging to the
Christian Church?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a hunch they were the same ones, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we actually were using stolen freezers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid of it, Dan. Someone played a joke
on us. Not a very nice joke either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;re guilty of what they said!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not guilty of anything, Dan. If those freezers
were taken from the church and delivered here,
how were we to know who brought them or why?
We accepted the gift in good faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trustees will have a better case than ever
against us now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They may try to make something of the incident.
However, I don&rsquo;t propose to worry about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think how much worse it would have been for
us, if Old Terry actually had found the freezers,&rdquo;
Brad chuckled. &ldquo;As it is, he has no evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Dan agreed relaxing. &ldquo;Whoever
swiped the ice cream, did us a small favor. I only
wish I knew for sure whether or not Pat had a
finger in the deal.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Given a little time, we may learn that too,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield replied, smiling.</p>
<p>Though the Cubs pressed him for an explanation,
the Cub leader would not reveal what was in his
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait and we&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;And while
you&rsquo;re waiting, don&rsquo;t forget to practice hard at basketball.
It&rsquo;s more important than ever now, that
we prove to Pat and his boys that Cubs can win
honorably!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">CHAPTER 10</span>
<br />OLD TERRY&rsquo;S DEMAND</h2>
<p>The loss of the two ice cream freezers and the
mystery surrounding them, distressed the Cubs. A
dozen questions plagued their minds. Had someone
stolen the freezers from the church and given
them to the organization just to cause trouble?</p>
<p>Who had tipped Old Terry that the containers
would be found at the Cub party? The Cubs kept
mulling over the affair and the conviction grew
upon them that Pat Oswald had been responsible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we never had agreed to play the basketball
series,&rdquo; Midge said gloomily one afternoon the
following week when the boys were at the gymnasium.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be the laughing stock of Webster City
if we lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if we lose fair and square,&rdquo; Dan returned,
undisturbed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no disgrace not to win. After all,
it&rsquo;s only a game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat and his boys from Bay Shore way have all
but ruined our reputations in this town!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The organization is under a cloud,&rdquo; Dan admitted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>The situation actually was more serious than he
liked to acknowledge. Since the night of the party,
word had spread throughout Webster City that Old
Terry had caught the Cubs with property stolen
from the Christian Church basement.</p>
<p>Friends and acquaintances of the Den 2 boys
knew that the tale was untrue. Whenever the Cubs
encountered others repeating the story, they denied
it vigorously. How well their assertions were believed,
they could not tell.</p>
<p>Never by word nor act had Mr. Hatfield even
hinted that he doubted the Cubs. Repeatedly he
assured them that the truth would come out in the
end. Yet, sometimes the Cub leader looked so worried,
the boys wondered if he weren&rsquo;t keeping really
bad news from them.</p>
<p>Since the night of the party, Dan had seen Pat
Oswald only once. The Bay Shore boy had come
to the Cub clubroom to ask if the Purple Five might
have a final practice in the gymnasium before the
Friday night game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Dan had told him. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to
talk to Mr. Hatfield about it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>Pat had loitered too long to please the Cubs. Deliberately,
he looked over the exhibits, the achievement
lists, and especially Fred&rsquo;s fort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heard your party was a bust the other night,&rdquo;
he twitted Dan. &ldquo;Someone stole your ice cream, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a low down trick.&rdquo; Dan looked the Bay
Shore boy squarely in the eyes and Pat&rsquo;s gaze wavered.
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t know anything about it, would
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, me? What an idea!&rdquo; Pat laughed uproarously.</p>
<p>He slipped out the clubroom door before Dan
could fire any more questions at him.</p>
<p>The Bay Shore boys practiced the following night
at the gymnasium. Brad, who witnessed the workout,
reported to the Cubs that the team had improved
considerably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Friday game will be no push-over for the
Cubs,&rdquo; he warned. &ldquo;Dig in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs spent every spare hour at the gymnasium,
practicing baskets and working out their team
plays. Both Dan and Midge were certain of final
selection as forwards. Red and Chips too were improving
daily in their ability to guard. Brad, at
center, though he did less practicing than the others,
was the surest of all the players at handling the ball.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>It was Chub who gave the Cubs concern. The
youngster tried hard enough, but his fingers seemed
coated with grease. Even if he received an easy,
straight pass, he missed as often as he caught the
ball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to use Chub as a substitute,&rdquo; Brad
told his teammates. &ldquo;The only thing is, what if one
of the regulars can&rsquo;t play? Or if he goes out on a
foul?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat&rsquo;s team is short a good substitute too,&rdquo; Dan
declared. &ldquo;No use borrowing trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was bouncing the ball lazily down the floor,
when the gymnasium door burst open. Midge and
Red rushed breathlessly in, fairly bursting with
news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on outside, quick!&rdquo; Red commanded.
&ldquo;Want to show you something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan, Brad and Chips quickly joined the other
two Cubs at the rear church steps. There stood the
two ice cream freezers, the lid missing from one
of the cans!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; Chips exclaimed, staring. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;d they
come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Midge and I just brought &rsquo;em from the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The river?&rdquo; echoed Dan. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Midge and I were hiking out that way,&rdquo; Red
explained. &ldquo;All at once, we came upon these two
cans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did they get there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone carried &rsquo;em, that&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; Red went on
grimly. &ldquo;Pat and his gang, I&rsquo;ll bet. The kids from
Bay Shore play along the river a lot. They&rsquo;ve made
a stick and grass hut down by the Hi-Level Bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was near the hut that we found the freezers,&rdquo;
Midge added.</p>
<p>The Cubs were relieved to recover the missing
containers, but uncertain what to do with them. One
of the freezers seemed as good as new after they
had washed out the metal cylinder which bore
traces of melted ice cream. The other can was bent
and the lid missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We looked everywhere in the brush for it,&rdquo;
Midge reported. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t find it anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad told the Cubs that not a moment must be
lost in returning the stolen property to Terry Treuhaft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All we can do is try to explain to him again what
happened, and offer to pay for the damaged freezer,&rdquo;
he advised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to return &rsquo;em,&rdquo; Dan agreed uneasily.
&ldquo;I hate to do it though. This will give him another
chance to accuse us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one wanted to be assigned the job of returning
the recovered property to Mr. Treuhaft. Because
the other Cubs were so reluctant, Dan and
Brad volunteered.</p>
<p>Both freezers were loaded into Dan&rsquo;s little red
wagon, and made a tight fit. As the two boys hauled
the containers down the street, they imagined that
everyone was staring at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think half the town heard that untrue story
about us taking these freezers,&rdquo; Dan said uncomfortably.
&ldquo;Now folks will think the worst, seeing us
haul them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done nothing dishonorable, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that, Brad. All the same, I feel sort of
funny. Everyone stares so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could go down this alley,&rdquo; Brad suggested,
halting the wagon at the entranceway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s,&rdquo; agreed Dan.</p>
<p>They turned into the narrow alley, pulling the
creaking wagon down the uneven bricks, past high
fences and garbage cans.</p>
<p>Unaccountably, Brad halted so suddenly that
the freezers nearly tumbled off the wagon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;See what I see, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Near the exit to the alley, a group of boys were
practicing basketball.</p>
<p>A make-shift netting had been attached to the
wall, serving as a basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Pat Oswald!&rdquo; Dan recognized one of
the players. &ldquo;No wonder he has a sure eye for a
basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not blaming him for practicing,&rdquo; Brad commented
in a low tone. &ldquo;More power to him! But it&rsquo;s
tough to have to do it in an alley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat didn&rsquo;t tell us about not having a practice
court.&rdquo; Dan now felt ashamed of himself for having
resented, even secretly, the Purple Five&rsquo;s use of the
church gymnasium.</p>
<p>Not wishing to appear to spy upon the Bay Shore
boys, Brad and Dan would have retreated. But as
they started to turn the wagon, its squeaking wheels
betrayed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, you!&rdquo; Pat shouted, recognizing them.</p>
<p>Brad and Dan then went on, well aware that the
freezers they hauled would create a sensation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you get those?&rdquo; Pat demanded suspiciously.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>Dan brought the wagon to a stop by the high
fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down by the river,&rdquo; he replied briefly. &ldquo;Some of
the Cubs found them near your hut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our hut? That&rsquo;s a laugh! You tryin&rsquo; to say we
took your old ice cream last Friday night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not making any accusations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;d better not, that&rsquo;s all I got to say!&rdquo;
Pat retorted. He glared at Dan, and then turned to
his cronies. &ldquo;Come on, guys! Let&rsquo;s scram! You can&rsquo;t
have any privacy these days, not even in an alley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan and Brad watched in amusement as the Bay
Shore boys clattered noisily off over the uneven
bricks. The thrust about finding the freezers near
the gang&rsquo;s hut had found its mark, they felt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat looked guilty when he saw these cans,&rdquo; Brad
remarked. &ldquo;It burns me he&rsquo;d engineer such a mean
trick, especially after the Cubs have been mighty
nice about the gymnasium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan had been studying the make-shift basket
netting fastened to the wall. A white chalk line,
evidently a foul line marker had been drawn on
the alley floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat and his boys must practice here often,&rdquo; he
remarked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d judge so, by the looks of the wall!&rdquo; In annoyance,
Brad pointed to a phrase which had been
chalked on the boards.</p>
<p>The wording read: &ldquo;The Cubs Are Sissies!&rdquo; And
higher up appeared the insult: &ldquo;Cubs are Crooks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan dropped the wagon tongue and rushed over
to wipe the offending words from the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the limit!&rdquo; he fumed. &ldquo;Brad, let&rsquo;s call off
that Friday game! Why should we play with such
wretched sports?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know how you feel, Dan,&rdquo; Brad answered
soothingly. &ldquo;Pat acts like a baby. He wants to get
our goat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s had mine for a long while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t very well call off the game,&rdquo; Brad said
slowly. &ldquo;Mr. Hatfield talked it over with me only
yesterday. He&rsquo;s heartsick at the way Pat has been
acting, but he thinks we should go ahead and set
the Bay View boys an example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather punch &rsquo;em in the nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll control myself,&rdquo; Dan grinned. &ldquo;Anyway,
I want to lick &rsquo;em in that Friday game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may not be so easy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>As Brad spoke, his gaze suddenly came to focus
upon knife scratchings on the board wall directly
behind the other boy. Without saying more, he
went over to inspect the deep cuts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another insult to the Cubs, I suppose,&rdquo; Dan
remarked.</p>
<p>Brad&rsquo;s broad shoulders blocked his view so that
he could not see what it was that the Den Chief
examined with such intent interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is something else, Dan,&rdquo; Brad said, finally
moving aside.</p>
<p>On the wall, freshly cut with a sharp knife, were
the carved initials: &ldquo;P. O.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat Oswald,&rdquo; Dan identified them. &ldquo;Seems to me
we&rsquo;ve seen those same initials, before, Brad. I guess
we know now, who wrecked the old church building!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">CHAPTER 11</span>
<br />THE LOCKED DOOR</h2>
<p>Discovery of the carved initials on the alley
wall convinced both Dan and Brad that the mutilation
had been done by Pat Oswald.</p>
<p>The Bay Shore boy, they were sure, had a careless
habit of using his jack-knife whenever he felt
like it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These letters &lsquo;P. O&rsquo; are made the same as the
ones we saw in the old church,&rdquo; Brad declared,
studying the knife cuts closely. &ldquo;At least I think so.
I wish we could compare them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this enough evidence to convict Pat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not, Dan. In the first place, being
convinced of a thing is a lot different than being
able to prove it. We didn&rsquo;t see Pat carve these initials,
nor those on the church pew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan lost interest in the wall markings. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the use then?&rdquo; he asked hopelessly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never be
able to prove anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. I have a hunch Pat will over-play
his hand. He&rsquo;s so cocky and sure of himself.
Given time he may trip himself up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe, but I doubt it. You know as well as I do,
that he and his bunch swiped our ice cream, but
will we ever be able to prove that either?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may. It takes time, Dan. You&rsquo;re too impatient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just hope things turn out the way you predict,
Brad. Somehow I&rsquo;ve got an uneasy feeling about
that game Friday night. You sure we shouldn&rsquo;t cancel
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With at least a hundred tickets sold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; Dan admitted. He sighed and
started with the wagon and the ice cream freezers
on down the deserted alley.</p>
<p>The scheduled basketball game between the two
teams had attracted an unusual amount of interest
in Webster City. Not only had the parents and
friends of the Cubs bought tickets at twenty-five
cents each, but a surprising number had been sold
to strangers and friends of Pat Oswald and his
group.</p>
<p>Though the Cubs had not really expected that the
ticket sale would bring in very much, they now realized
that it would swell their treasury considerably.
The money already was earmarked for the payment
of attorney fees, if needed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>After a long, tiring haul, the two Cubs eventually
arrived with the freezers at Terry Treuhaft&rsquo;s cottage.
The yard was choked with unraked leaves and
the garage doors were locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one at home,&rdquo; Dan observed. &ldquo;Just our luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After rapping several times without an answer, the
boys debated what to do. Brad was opposed to
hauling the freezers back to the clubroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could leave them here,&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be better to take them back to the
church? That&rsquo;s where they belong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; Brad agreed. &ldquo;After we get home, I&rsquo;ll
telephone Terry or one of the trustees so they&rsquo;ll
know we returned them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old Christian churchyard looked more forlorn
than ever as the boys presently came up to it
with their creaking wagon. The lawn was deep
with crackling brown leaves which filled shoes
with a fine dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, we could build a dandy fort here,&rdquo; Dan remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And get run off the premises again! Nothing doing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>Dan grinned goodnaturedly, for the idea had not
been a serious one. He was as eager as Brad to be
rid of the ice cream freezers and be on his way
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;ll we leave &rsquo;em?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Not out
front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;ll be safer around back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys circled the church, finally halting by a
rear door which led down into the basement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s open!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed.</p>
<p>Someone had left the door unlocked, for it stood
an inch or two ajar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe Terry is here, or one of the trustees,
Dan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cautiously, the Cubs opened the door wider.
They could see no one in the dark hallway. Nor
could they hear anyone moving about inside the
old church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone here?&rdquo; Brad finally shouted.</p>
<p>His voice echoed faintly, but there was no other
sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer,&rdquo; the Den Chief muttered. &ldquo;The church
is empty. But this door shouldn&rsquo;t have been unlocked.
No wonder so much damage was done here.
Terry isn&rsquo;t as careful about looking after the place
as he&rsquo;d have the trustees believe.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So long&rsquo;s the door is unlocked, why not take the
freezers down into the basement where they belong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We-ll,&rdquo; Brad hesitated. &ldquo;Think we should?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will only take a jiffy. They&rsquo;ll be a lot safer
there than setting outside where anyone coming
along could grab &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Brad consented. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s be quick about
it though. I&rsquo;d hate to have Terry or one of the
trustees catch us here. Then they&rsquo;d really have a
complaint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With dispatch, the Cubs unloaded the first freezer
and carried it between them to the cellar. The main
furnace room was damp and musty. A rat scurried
past, nearly brushing Dan&rsquo;s leg.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woops!&rdquo; he exclaimed, shivering. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like
this dark old hole, Brad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you the one who wanted to bring the
freezers down here?&rdquo; Brad reminded him with a
chuckle. &ldquo;That old rat won&rsquo;t hurt you. He was more
scared than you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says I&rsquo;m scared? It just startled me, that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>The boys carried the freezer into the fruit closet.
Nearly all of the long shelves which lined the wall
were empty. A few cans of homemade fruit, evidently
abandoned when the church was closed, remained.
Dan noticed that a can of peaches and one
of strawberries had been broken open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s get that other freezer and be out
of here,&rdquo; Brad urged. &ldquo;No time to start looking
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In haste, they went upstairs again to fetch the
second container. Brad breathed a relieved sigh
when it was safely on the shelf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d hate what?&rdquo; Dan demanded as the other
suddenly broke off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Let&rsquo;s get out of here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan knew from Brad&rsquo;s odd manner that something
had startled him. As for himself, he had heard
no unusual sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; he demanded, dropping his voice
to a half-whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t start whispering or you&rsquo;ll give me the
jitters,&rdquo; Brad scolded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did hear something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the creaking of a board.&rdquo; Brad forced himself
to be indifferent. &ldquo;But what of it? This building
has been closed up for a long while and the wood
is dry. It wasn&rsquo;t anything.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go,&rdquo; Dan urged, leading the way up the
dark stairs.</p>
<p>Though he wouldn&rsquo;t have admitted it, he too felt
suddenly uneasy. In a way, it had been foolish of
them to enter the empty building. If someone should
find them there, it might be all but impossible to
convince anyone of their true purpose.</p>
<p>The Cubs relaxed a bit as they reached the top
of the basement stairs. Their fear of not being alone
in the building began to ebb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, while we&rsquo;re here, I might take another quick
look at those initials that were carved on the church
bench,&rdquo; Brad proposed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll probably never get
another chance like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Dan agreed reluctantly. &ldquo;But make it
snappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Brad went into the main part of the church,
the denner remained in the vestibule. He caught
himself shivering. Nervousness? Or was it the chill
wind which came in occasional drafts down the circular
iron stairway leading to the belfry?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Brad would hurry,&rdquo; Dan kept thinking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>He was annoyed by his own uneasiness. What
was it about this old church building that always
gave him the same uncomfortable feeling? Why
did he have that vague sensation&mdash;a sort of conviction
that someone was watching him? Every crack
and cranny of the vestibule seemed to have leering
eyes.</p>
<p>Dan began to think of the first day he had visited
the place. Chub too had been uneasy. Even then
there had been strange sounds, a tapping bell, a
shadowy figure in the church graveyard. And why
had the church door been left unlocked?</p>
<p>A slight noise which he could not immediately
localize, caused Dan to stiffen. Had the sound come
from the belfry room? A bat, perhaps.</p>
<p>Dan listened intently. Distinctly, he could hear
tiptoeing steps on the iron stairway! Someone was
up there, stealthily descending!</p>
<p>Panic momentarily overcame the boy. &ldquo;Brad!&rdquo; he
yelled. &ldquo;Brad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was reassuring to hear the older Cub yell:
&ldquo;Coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Brad demanded, popping into
the vestibule. &ldquo;You look as if you&rsquo;d seen a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see anything, but I have a bad case of
the jitters,&rdquo; Dan admitted sheepishly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time we quit this place anyhow,&rdquo; Brad replied.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure those carved initials on the pew
are the same as the ones we saw in the alley. Pat
Oswald must have carved them both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan nodded scarcely listening. He cast an uneasy
glance toward the iron stairway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s wrong with you anyhow?&rdquo; Brad demanded.</p>
<p>Dan was ashamed to tell him of his fears. Now
that Brad was with him again, he didn&rsquo;t feel as
nervous as before. Like as not he&rsquo;d allowed his
imagination to play tricks on him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s wrong,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the vestibule. Dan reached for the knob
of the rear, outside door. When he twisted it, an
empty feeling came into his stomach. He tugged,
but the door refused to budge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuck?&rdquo; Brad asked, moving close.</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s lips had drawn into a tight, white line.
&ldquo;Not stuck,&rdquo; he managed in a faint voice, &ldquo;Locked!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">CHAPTER 12</span>
<br />RULES OF BASKETBALL</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Locked?&rdquo; Brad repeated, stunned by Dan&rsquo;s disclosure.
&ldquo;Why, it couldn&rsquo;t be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went quickly to the door to test it for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re trapped in here,&rdquo; Dan gasped, truly unnerved.
&ldquo;Someone must have come along and locked
us in. What&rsquo;ll we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it cool, for one thing,&rdquo; Brad replied, forcing
himself to remain very calm. &ldquo;Hey, look here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to the bolt which had been shot into
place from the inside of the building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what d&rsquo;you know?&rdquo; Dan mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your excitement, you must have locked that
door yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did!&rdquo; Dan denied. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been near
this door since we came in and toted the freezers
downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how&rsquo;d it get locked from the inside? I
know I didn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>As the full realization of what could have happened,
dawned upon the two, they stared at each
other an instant. Neither voiced the thought that
someone might be in the building with them, but
Dan involuntarily raised his eyes toward the darkening
belfry steps. Those creaking sounds he had
heard now seemed to have significance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see if we can get out of here,&rdquo; Brad said
gruffly.</p>
<p>The bolt stuck. He struck it sharply with his fist,
and it flew back. The door opened readily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a relief!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed, drawing a natural
breath again. &ldquo;And how!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two cubs hurriedly left the building. Having
no key, they could not lock the church door from
the outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, we&rsquo;re leaving it just as we found it,&rdquo;
Brad said. &ldquo;Dan, you&rsquo;re sure you didn&rsquo;t slip that
bolt in an absent-minded moment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Positive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I.&rdquo; Brad frowned thoughtfully. &ldquo;It must
have been done while we were in the cellar. But
who did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what became of the person who locked us
in?&rdquo; Dan demanded in a hushed voice. &ldquo;Do you
suppose&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He, she or IT is still in there?&rdquo; Brad finished the
sentence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have to admit it&rsquo;s sort of spooky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s disturbing all right,&rdquo; Brad agreed. &ldquo;Maybe
we were locked in by accident. But if so, someone
had to be in that church. And that someone must
be still there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs gazed reflectively at the old building.
Despite their suspicion that it might have an occupant,
nothing could have induced them to return
for an inspection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was Terry,&rdquo; Brad said doubtfully. &ldquo;He
could have heard us inside, and played a joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan shook his head. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Terry, I&rsquo;m sure,
Brad. If he had caught us there, he would have
raised cain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan indicated the little red wagon which had
been used to haul the freezers. He pointed out that
anyone approaching the old church certainly would
have seen it and know of their presence inside the
building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone did it to scare us away, Brad,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell you, but I was sure I heard
footsteps on the stairway leading to the belfry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think someone may have been hiding there,
Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m wondering.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not one of Pat&rsquo;s gang, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This old church is awfully close to the river and
the railroad tracks,&rdquo; Dan remarked. &ldquo;Someone could
be using the place without the trustees knowing. I
suspect Old Terry isn&rsquo;t as careful about keeping
windows and doors locked as he&rsquo;s supposed to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could go back inside and check&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not now, anyway,&rdquo; Dan said quickly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in
enough hot water as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad agreed with the denner that it would be
unwise to investigate further that day. He proposed,
however, that they inform Mr. Hatfield of their
findings, and also Terry Treuhaft.</p>
<p>The very next day, Dan ran into the old caretaker
on a downtown street. Drawing him into conversation,
he told of finding the unlocked door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d it get unlocked?&rdquo; Terry demanded. &ldquo;I
never left it that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The caretaker was not as angry about the Cubs
returning the ice cream freezers as Dan had expected
him to be. Encouraged, he even dared reveal
that the lid to one of the containers was missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo; Old Terry grunted. &ldquo;I reckon it can&rsquo;t be
helped. Anyhow, those freezers ain&rsquo;t been used in
years.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seemingly, they intend to go ahead with their
court action,&rdquo; the Cub leader informed the boys.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to hire ourselves a lawyer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Advance ticket sale for the Friday night basketball
had been very large. On the evening of the
game, the gymnasium was packed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ll bet we&rsquo;ve taken in twenty or thirty dollars
at least!&rdquo; Fred Hatfield excitedly reported to
the other Cubs. &ldquo;This will be a big boost for our
treasury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Game time was at seven o&rsquo;clock. Shortly before
the hour, Pat Oswald and his four players trotted
out on the floor to practice a few baskets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a load of those suits!&rdquo; Chips muttered to
Dan.</p>
<p>The five players wore new, bright-hued purple
sport shirts. By contrast, the Cubs had non-descript
shorts and shirts, no two alike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And look at that guy shoot baskets,&rdquo; Chips went
on gloomily. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t miss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded his head toward Pat, who was winning
applause from the crowd by his dead-aim at
the basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just get in there and guard him,&rdquo; Dan urged.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him get a chance a throw.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>Dan gazed at the caretaker in sheer amazement,
wondering if he were ill. Why this sudden change
of heart toward the Cubs?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the tip about the door,&rdquo; Terry said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll check up on it right away.&rdquo; He started off, then
paused and said awkwardly: &ldquo;About that suit the
trustees are threatening to bring&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wanted you to know, I kinda changed my
ideas about the Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you realize we had nothing to do with
wrecking that building or taking the freezers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I been checkin&rsquo; around,&rdquo; the caretaker admitted.
&ldquo;Folks everywhere have a good word for the Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you could convince the trustees they
should drop their action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t be so easy, Dan,&rdquo; Terry sighed. &ldquo;Mr.
Maxwell is a determined man. I&rsquo;ll put in a good
word though for the Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Dan said gratefully. &ldquo;Thanks a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next few days he waited expectantly, hoping
that very good news would come of his talk with
Terry. When nothing happened, he and the other
Cubs became discouraged again. From Mr. Hatfield
they learned that apparently there had been no
change in the attitude of the church trustees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>The game began with one of the high school
teachers, Jim Veeley, acting as referee.</p>
<p>Midge and Dan played as forwards, Chips
guarded Pat Oswald, and Red was assigned to
another bulky player. Fred and Chub sat on the
sidelines as substitutes.</p>
<p>Brad, several inches shorter than his opponent at
center, missed the toss-up. The Purple Five gained
possession of the ball. Back and forth they passed
it, jeering at the Cubs. Then they fed it to Pat.</p>
<p>Before Chips could come awake, the Purple Five
forward brushed roughly past him. Quick as a cat,
he dribbled directly under the basket, and hooked
an easy one through the netting.</p>
<p>The Purple Five had scored in the first minute
of play!</p>
<p>A ripple of applause came from the audience for
the basket had been a pretty one. On the south side
of the gymnasium where rooters for the Bay Shore
boys had congregated, loud cheering broke out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in there, Cubs!&rdquo; rooters for Den 2 called.
&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<p>The Cubs were on their toes now, determined
not to let the Purple Five score again. But they
couldn&rsquo;t seem to get their hands on the ball.</p>
<p>Pat was a one-man team, darting here, there
everywhere. Poor Chips was winded trying to keep
up with the fleet-footed forward. Repeatedly, the
Purple Five scored, while Dan managed only one
basket.</p>
<p>As the Purple Five&rsquo;s score climbed, Pat became
even more flashy and bold. He&rsquo;d shove Chips aside
to snatch the ball, and twice he jabbed him with
his elbow. Twice the referee warned him for roughness.
Then he called a personal foul.</p>
<p>A howl of indignation went up from the section
of Bay Shore rooters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Served Pat right!&rdquo; Chips muttered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been
getting by with murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took his place on the freethrow line, waited
for the noise to subside, and tossed the ball. It went
through the netting, tallying a point for the Cubs.</p>
<p>After that, two other fouls were called in rapid
succession on Pat. In each instance, the Cubs scored
on the freethrow.</p>
<p>When the half finally ended, the score stood 10 to
5 in favor of the Purple Five.</p>
<p>As the boys rested, Mr. Veeley came around to
speak to Pat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One more foul and you&rsquo;ll be out of the game,&rdquo; he
warned. &ldquo;Better watch it next half.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The game began again and Pat observed the
rules more carefully. But now, instead of trying
repeatedly for the ball, he would bounce it lazily
back and forth among his teammates. Clearly, the
Bay Shore boys meant to play a delaying game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Break it up! Break it up!&rdquo; shouted the rooters.</p>
<p>The Cubs tried their best. Seeing the ball coming
toward him on a straight pass, Dan reached for it.</p>
<p>At that instant, Pat darted in, striking the Cub&rsquo;s
arm just as his fingers would have closed upon the
ball.</p>
<p>A howl of anger arose from the crowd. Mr. Veeley
held up his hands in signal of another personal
fowl on Pat.</p>
<p>Dan made the free throw. Pat was ordered off
the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have
any regular substitute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His arguments were unavailing. Pat finally left the
floor, muttering to himself. A lean, lanky substitute
took his place.</p>
<p>After that, it was a losing game for the Purple
Five. With Pat on the sidelines, the team collapsed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>The Cubs brought the score even, and then Dan
dropped three baskets in succession to win the game
by a six point margin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we won, boy!&rdquo; Brad declared as they trotted
off the floor after the final whistle had blown.
&ldquo;You were great, Dan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t have too much competition after Pat
went out of the game,&rdquo; Dan replied, brushing dirt
from his shorts. &ldquo;I wish we could have won with
him opposing us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was his own fault,&rdquo; Brad shrugged. &ldquo;Mr. Veeley
warned him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Purple Five and their rooters took defeat
with poor grace. There were mutterings of &ldquo;We
were robbed!&rdquo; and remarks that the referee had
been unfair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you want to call off the other two games,&rdquo;
Brad suggested quietly to Pat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such thing,&rdquo; the other boy retorted. &ldquo;Next
time we&rsquo;ll lick you so you&rsquo;ll never forget it. Besides,
we need the cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean?&rdquo; Brad demanded, already
guessing the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gate,&rdquo; Pat explained with an impudent grin.
&ldquo;You Cubs took in a lot of dough tonight. Well, we
want our share. Half of it belongs to us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">CHAPTER 13</span>
<br />HALLOWEEN PRANKS</h2>
<p>Word spread around the gymnasium of Pat&rsquo;s outrageous
demand. Brad and Dan brought Mr. Hatfield,
fully expecting him to reject the request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat, you feel you should have half the money?&rdquo;
the Cub leader questioned him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; The captain of the Purple Five eyed the
group of Cubs defiantly. However, his gaze wavered
under the level scrutiny of Mr. Hatfield. &ldquo;We
earned it, didn&rsquo;t we? What&rsquo;s more, we&rsquo;d have won
the game, if we hadn&rsquo;t been cheated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cubs do not cheat,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield replied. &ldquo;When
you know more about the organization, you&rsquo;ll understand
that. We play according to the rules, that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make &rsquo;em to suit yourselves,&rdquo; Pat growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, you&rsquo;ll find them all printed in
the official rule book on basketball. It might be well
for your team to study up a bit before the next
scheduled game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll study all right! Now, how about the dough?
You&rsquo;re holding out, I take it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If you feel you&rsquo;re entitled to a share, you may
have it,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said. He turned to Dan, saying:
&ldquo;Go bring Mr. Holloway. He has all the money
we collected tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s jaw dropped, but he obeyed the order without
question. What had come over the Cub leader
anyhow? Pat and the Bay Shore boys certainly
hadn&rsquo;t done anything to earn any of the money!
Why, the Cubs had sold nearly all of the tickets. Besides,
the organization would be expected to pay
the church a small fee for use of the gymnasium to
cover lights and heating. It was unfair!</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway came quickly, carrying a box in
which were the receipts. He reported to the Cub
leader that the correct total was $30.80.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat here demands half as his share,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told him that he may have it. The
Cubs make a point of being honest. We&rsquo;d rather
lose the entire amount than to take one penny that
doesn&rsquo;t belong to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat&rsquo;s cheeks flamed, but he continued to grin in
a silly, arrogant sort of way.</p>
<p>Mr. Holloway counted out exactly $15.40 which
he poured into the boy&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;Sure it&rsquo;s enough?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it do.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>As he pocketed the cash, Pat&rsquo;s gaze again swept
the group of Cubs. Though no one spoke, their silence
made him fully aware of their contempt. He
hesitated and for just an instant, Dan thought he
intended to return the money. Then, with a shrug,
Pat was gone.</p>
<p>Once his footsteps had died away, the Cubs gave
vent to their anger. Mr. Hatfield allowed them to
have their say without comment. He did not try to
explain his action in giving the money to Pat. His
only remark was: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying a little experiment,
boys. Let&rsquo;s wait and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the talk was at his height, Fred came rushing
into the gymnasium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, come quick!&rdquo; he urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Brad demanded. &ldquo;Anyone
hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on and I&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; Fred answered,
motioning for the boys to follow him upstairs to
the clubroom. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so mad I could chew nails!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs, followed by Mr. Hatfield and Mr. Holloway,
hastened up the stairway. Fred dramatically
flung open the clubroom door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just look!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;This must have been
done only a few minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>The cardboard fort which had been built with
such painstaking care, lay demolished on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All my work&mdash;gone!&rdquo; Fred said.</p>
<p>No one spoke for a moment. Everyone felt sick
at heart. All the Cubs had been proud of the fort
and knew that Fred had spent hours of time completing
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was wrecked right after the game,&rdquo; Fred
said bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you place the time?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s
voice was quiet though troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dropped in here for a minute between halves
of the game. The fort was okay then. When I came
upstairs just a bit ago, this was what I found!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat or some of his gang did it,&rdquo; Chips announced
with finality. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all the thanks we get for giving
&rsquo;em half the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d do a trick like this,&rdquo; Mr.
Hatfield said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d hoped&mdash;well, I thought Pat had
good stuff in him buried deep down in. Seems I
was mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to report this to the police,&rdquo; Red said
indignantly. &ldquo;Want me to call &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Red. This is hardly a case for the police.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;How about those other two basketball games?&rdquo;
Midge asked. &ldquo;Will we play them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I think, is for the Cubs to decide. After
what happened tonight, I&rsquo;m sure we&rsquo;d be justified
in cancelling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only trouble is that if we do, they&rsquo;ll go around
Webster City calling us yellow,&rdquo; Brad said. He began
picking up the scattered sections of the destroyed
fort. &ldquo;I say, let&rsquo;s play the series, and lick
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The debate waxed warm for a few minutes.
Finally, however, a majority of the Cubs voted in
favor of carrying on the series.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, if that&rsquo;s the decision,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
said. &ldquo;One thing, though! The game must not be
used as a means of venting spite on the Bay Shore
boys. If we play them, we must conduct ourselves
as good sports. Agreed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next game had been scheduled for the following
Friday. With Pat and his players claiming
half the receipts, the Cubs had far less enthusiasm
for selling tickets during the week. Nevertheless,
news had traveled that the game would be a good
one. Accordingly, many persons stopped the Cubs
on the street to ask for the tickets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>The Cubs were not surprised to learn that Pat
had told around that the Purple Five had been
cheated out of victory on a technicality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be laying for us next game,&rdquo; Brad
warned the boys of Den 2 one night as they practiced
at the church gymnasium. &ldquo;If we want to win,
we&rsquo;ve got to improve our teamwork.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs had worked out several new plays
which seemed to go fairly well. Chub however,
could not get the hang of them. The others noticed
that his mind never seemed entirely on the game.
A ball would be tossed in his direction, and he&rsquo;d
seem aware of it only after it had shot past him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chub, you&rsquo;ve got to wake up!&rdquo; Brad scolded
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; Chub apologized.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d try harder for awhile, and then his mind
would wander again. The Cubs felt sorry for him
because obviously he meant well. Chub though,
was a total loss to the team, even as a substitute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s bothering Chub,&rdquo; Brad confided to
Dan. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s worrying about things, and he&rsquo;ll never
be any good until he gets it off his chest. Any idea
what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_137">[137]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It may be because he hasn&rsquo;t any father or
mother,&rdquo; Dan replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve tried to talk to him
now and then, but he never opens up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next few days were so delightful that the
Cubs abandoned basketball for hikes. They decorated
their clubroom with cornshocks and pumpkins
obtained from a nearby farm.</p>
<p>Fred made cardboard witches for the walls, and
in the work forgot his disappointment over loss of
the cardboard fort.</p>
<p>All the Cubs fashioned Halloween costumes and
laid plans for another party. They took care however,
that Pat and his cronies should not learn of
the affair.</p>
<p>Regularly, on Tuesdays and Thursdays, the
Purple Five practiced thirty minutes in the church
gymnasium. The Bay Shore area boys now were
much better behaved and quieter while in the
building.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Cubs could not forget past actions.
By agreement no mention was made of the
destroyed cardboard fort. The conviction remained
however, that Pat and his gang were responsible
for it as well as the damage to the old Christian
Church. Nor had they forgotten the ice cream
freezer episode or Pat&rsquo;s unfair demand for half of
the game receipts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>The Bay Shore boys were treated politely, but
none of the Cubs warmed to them. Furthermore,
while the Purple Five team was in the building, the
clubroom always was kept locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You guys don&rsquo;t trust us much, do you?&rdquo; Pat demanded
of Dan one afternoon on the final practice
session before the coming Friday game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; Dan avoided the issue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why do you lock the clubroom? So we can&rsquo;t
look in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our cardboard fort was wrecked, Pat. Fred had
worked weeks on it. We don&rsquo;t want anything like
that to happen again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat bristled, and color flamed into his cheeks.
&ldquo;You think we did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say so, did I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but you&rsquo;re acting mighty suspicious. I&rsquo;m
tired of being treated as if we have to be watched
all the time. Believe me, if we wanted to do mischief,
we could tear this place apart! But we got
other plans for Halloween. Not a silly party either.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>Pat&rsquo;s boastful manner instantly convinced Dan
that the Purple Five team was planning mischief,
come October 31. He asked a few casual questions,
hoping to draw the other boys out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d like to know, wouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Pat teased.
He looped a ball through the basket, and called to
his teammates. &ldquo;Come on, guys! Let&rsquo;s move out of
here! We got some important business to talk over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan was disturbed by the hints the other had
dropped. Undoubtedly, the Bay Shore boys intended
to commit Halloween pranks. He only hoped the
Cubs would not be blamed.</p>
<p>He heard no more of the matter and had nearly
forgotten about it when Halloween finally came.
The Den 2 boys had arranged a party at the Holloway
home.</p>
<p>Everyone dressed in costume and the affair was a
great success. Fred, as usual, won first prize, fixing
himself up as an armored knight.</p>
<p>Dan wore an ordinary clown suit. The other Cubs
came as ghosts or in over-sized clothes borrowed
from their parents.</p>
<p>The party broke up at an early hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No mischief tonight, boys,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield warned
as he dismissed the group. &ldquo;But then, I know I can
trust Cubs to behave themselves always.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>Several of the Den 2 members were riding home
with their parents. Dan and Brad had come alone.
Mr. Hatfield offered to drive them home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to,&rdquo; Brad turned down the offer. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
only a step. We don&rsquo;t mind walking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about you, Chub?&rdquo; the Cub leader inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see him home,&rdquo; Dan volunteered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not much out of our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still wearing their costumes, the boys started
away from the Holloway home. In this neighborhood,
the streets were quiet. Some distance away,
they could hear the dinging of a cowbell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice night for the witches to howl!&rdquo; Dan said
jokingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No pranks for us,&rdquo; Brad replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going
home and to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enroute to Chub&rsquo;s home, the boys met two groups
of masked children returning from parties. Lights
blazed on residential porches, and a few small children
were ringing doorbells, demanding: &ldquo;Trick or
Treat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kid stuff,&rdquo; Dan remarked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re too
old for that silliness.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>Chub was left safely at his doorstep. Brad and
Dan then turned off toward their own neighborhood.
As they approached the old Christian Church,
unconsciously they began to walk faster.</p>
<p>Suddenly, they were startled to hear a rush of
footsteps in the direction of the old deserted building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Brad demanded, halting to listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like a gang of kids, running,&rdquo; Dan instantly
decided. &ldquo;Toward the church too! Golly, I
hope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs would be sunk if any more damage is
done there,&rdquo; Brad finished for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s find out what&rsquo;s happening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, Dan. We&rsquo;ll have to move fast though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Breaking into a run, the two headed directly for
the church. As they approached from the front
they could see no one on the grounds. A nearly full
moon, rising through the bare branches of a scraggly
tree, cast a soft, weird glow over the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see anyone&mdash;&rdquo; Brad began, only to break
off.</p>
<p>The two listeners had heard a door slam. They
were certain the sound had come from the rear of
the old building.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>Noiselessly, Brad and Dan moved around the
hedge to approach the church from the river side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; Dan directed the other&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>A group of five or six boys clustered at the rear of
the building, near an open coal chute. The sound
which the Cubs had taken for the slamming of a
door, had, in reality been the banging of the chute
cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Pat and his bunch!&rdquo; Dan recognized them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bent on trouble too! They&rsquo;re going into that
building, and we&rsquo;ll get the blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the pair crept cautiously nearer, they could
hear Pat giving orders to his followers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go first,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;Then the rest of you
follow. All but Pete, who&rsquo;s to stay here and keep
watch. We&rsquo;ll get that bell from the belfry and dump
it on main street!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He disappeared feet first down the chute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The belfry bell!&rdquo; Dan whispered in alarm. &ldquo;This
is the worst yet! If Pat gets by with it, the Cubs are
almost sure to be blamed. What are we going to do,
Brad? How can we stop &rsquo;em?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">CHAPTER 14</span>
<br />THE BELFRY BELL</h2>
<p>Brad could not provide a ready answer to Dan&rsquo;s
demand for a means of stopping the Bay Shore boys
in their Halloween prank.</p>
<p>The boy called Pete had been left on guard at
the entrance to the coal chute. Pat and at least five
others now were inside the empty building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re two against six,&rdquo; Brad muttered. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t stop &rsquo;em, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to let them take the bell! The trustees are
almost certain to blame the Cubs. If they&rsquo;d only
come here now and learn the truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad had been thinking fast. &ldquo;Our best bet is to
telephone Mr. Hatfield and have him call the police,&rdquo;
he whispered. &ldquo;It will take &rsquo;em a few minutes
to get that bell down. They aren&rsquo;t going to unfasten
it half as easy as they think!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will weigh a ton too! Say, maybe we will have
time enough to nab &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You dash for a &rsquo;phone, Dan,&rdquo; Brad advised in a
whisper. &ldquo;Sneak around behind the hedge and don&rsquo;t
let that kid, Pete, see you. I&rsquo;ll keep watch until you
get back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hurry as fast as I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan started to creep away. He had taken less
than three steps when a sudden commotion inside
the church brought him up sharply.</p>
<p>From the interior of the building, issued an eerie
scream.</p>
<p>Then utter confusion! He could hear Pat and the
other Bay Shore boys gasping and yelling as they
evidently pushed and shoved one another down
the iron stairway which led from the belfry.</p>
<p>Dan couldn&rsquo;t guess what had happened. Had one
of the boys fallen on the stairs? But surely that
wouldn&rsquo;t have been enough to have caused such
panic.</p>
<p>As he hesitated, wondering whether to wait or
hasten on to find a telephone, the intruders began
to pour out of the building.</p>
<p>Pat was the first to crawl through the narrow
opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Pete demanded. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
the bell?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bell?&rdquo; Pat laughed hysterically. &ldquo;That bell can
stay up there forever! The church is haunted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other Bay Shore boys came out of the coal
chute as fast as they could squeeze through. Without
even waiting for their buddies, they started on
a run away from the building.</p>
<p>Pat and Pete stayed until the last member of
their gang had reached safety. Hastily, they
slammed down the door of the coal chute.</p>
<p>At that moment, from overhead, came the faint
tap-tap-tap of the church bell. It was a muted sound
but one which could not have been caused by the
light breeze which was blowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear that?&rdquo; Pat muttered fearfully. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting
away from this place&mdash;fast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fled, leaving Pete to bound after him. In
another moment, Dan and Brad were the only two
left in the churchyard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you know?&rdquo; Brad chuckled, recovering
from the rapidity of the flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We lost our chance to trap &rsquo;em inside the building,&rdquo;
Dan said regretfully, returning to stand beside
the Den Chief at the coal chute opening. &ldquo;What
do you suppose happened in there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I knew. Want to go inside and find out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, are you kidding?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, I am,&rdquo; Brad chuckled. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t drag
me into that building tonight. All the same, I&rsquo;m
mighty curious. Pat and his boys must have seen
or heard something that completely unnerved them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat&rsquo;s no coward either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it would take plenty to jolt him, Dan. It was
more than just a tapping bell.&rdquo; Brad gazed thoughtfully
up at the dark belfry.</p>
<p>Dan shivered, feeling ill at ease. &ldquo;That bell&rsquo;s
enough to give me the jim-jams,&rdquo; he confessed.
&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the first time we&rsquo;re heard it. How do you
explain it, Brad? You don&rsquo;t think the church could
be&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haunted? Say, be your age!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s silly,&rdquo; Dan admitted, sheepishly. &ldquo;But
so many queer things have happened here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man-made queer things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that, Brad?&rdquo; Dan quickly
caught him up.</p>
<p>The older boy, however, did not answer. He
moved back a few paces so that he could obtain a
better view of the shadowy belfry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See anything?&rdquo; Dan asked, following him nervously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t imagine the tapping of that bell,
Brad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it sounded all right. And it didn&rsquo;t ring by
itself either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think someone may be up there&mdash;right
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gosh, it scares me to think about it,&rdquo; Dan muttered.
&ldquo;Even now, someone might be watching us,
and we couldn&rsquo;t see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get yourself worked up,&rdquo; Brad advised in
a matter-of-fact voice. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re safe enough here so
long as we don&rsquo;t go inside the building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys circled the church, studying it from
every angle. Now that Pat and the others had fled,
it was difficult to believe that anything ever had
been amiss. The old building appeared as deserted
as on the day when the Cubs first had seen it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, we know how Pat and his bunch
got inside the church that first time,&rdquo; Dan commented.
&ldquo;Through the coal chute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both he and Dan felt a trifle discouraged over
the outcome of their little adventure. With half a
break they might have caught the Bay Shore boys
inside the building! Now, it seemed they were no
closer than ever to proving the innocence of the
Cubs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No use to telephone Mr. Hatfield now, or to call
the police,&rdquo; Dan remarked, sunk in gloom. &ldquo;We
muffed it right, Brad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wouldn&rsquo;t say so.&rdquo; The older boy was quite
cheerful. &ldquo;We learned quite a bit. And we can be
sure of one thing. I don&rsquo;t think Pat and his pals will
come back here for awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not after the way they poured out of that building.&rdquo;
Dan grinned at the recollection. &ldquo;I sure wish
we could have had a picture! Even Pat was scared
half out of his wits!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hearing that bell tap gave me quite a start myself,&rdquo;
Brad admitted frankly. &ldquo;I wish I knew what
it was that scared those kids. They must have seen
something&mdash;not a ghost either!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to come back here sometime to investigate?&rdquo;
Dan proposed, half jokingly. &ldquo;When it&rsquo;s daylight,
I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I will,&rdquo; the Den Chief replied. &ldquo;I intend
to talk this over with Mr. Hatfield. If he thinks we
wouldn&rsquo;t run afoul of the trustees, I may try to get
in there again to see what I can learn.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">CHAPTER 15</span>
<br />MEASLES</h2>
<p>Halloween was two days gone and no further
investigation had been made of the old church by
the river.</p>
<p>Brad had gone to Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s home, fully intending
to tell him of seeing Pat and his pals flee
in panic from the building.</p>
<p>He never had been able to make his report. Mr.
Hatfield, it developed, had been called out of the
city on an important business trip. In his absence,
Den 2 was under the direction of Mr. Holloway.</p>
<p>The Cub leader, Brad learned, expected to be
back in Webster City in time for the Friday night
basketball game with the Purple Five.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We really shouldn&rsquo;t play that outfit, knowing
what we do about &rsquo;em,&rdquo; the Den Chief confided to
Dan. &ldquo;Think we should tell the other Cubs what we
know?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do any good, unless we cancel the
game,&rdquo; Dan replied after thinking the matter over.
&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield seemed to want us to treat Pat and
his bunch with good will. So I suppose, if he were
here, he&rsquo;d advise us to go ahead with the game just
as if nothing had happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we won&rsquo;t say anything about the church
affair,&rdquo; Brad decided. &ldquo;It would only stir up bad
feeling. The Cubs have it in for Pat as it is&mdash;and
for good reasons too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though the Den Chief had tried to keep his feelings
from the younger boys, he was not too happy
about the coming game. Pat and the Bay Shore boys
smarted under the first defeat they had suffered
from the Cubs. The second game in the series might
be bitterly fought.</p>
<p>As for trying to pin evidence on Pat that he and
his gang were responsible for the trouble at the
Christian Church, he scarcely knew where to start.
Any accusation he or Dan might make, would, of
course, be denied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about going out there again and trying to
get in?&rdquo; Dan proposed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait until Mr. Hatfield gets back,&rdquo; Brad
turned him down. &ldquo;With the accusation standing
against us that we once broke into the place, we&rsquo;ve
got to be cautious. If anyone should see us there,
they might misunderstand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So matters stood. Basketball practice went on
each night after school. And outwardly at least, the
Cubs were friendly with the Purple Five.</p>
<p>On the Friday set for the game, the Den 2 boys
called a 15-minute practice session after school in
the gymnasium.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re only going to shoot a few baskets and run
through a couple of team plays,&rdquo; Brad instructed
the group. &ldquo;I want to be sure you fellows have it
down pat. We&rsquo;ll run through Play B first. Chips, get
in there, and start it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chips, who slouched on a bench, moved sluggishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to get more pep than that unless we
want to be licked tonight,&rdquo; Brad said, passing him
the ball. &ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s the matter with you anyhow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel awful,&rdquo; Chips admitted in a weak voice.
&ldquo;Sort of sickish all over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at his face!&rdquo; Dan directed.</p>
<p>Chips&rsquo; cheeks and forehead were flushed. Even
more alarming, the back of his neck was blotched
with little red spots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I itch too,&rdquo; Chips said miserably.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>The Cubs who had clustered about him, backed
hastily away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo;my gosh,&rdquo; Brad groaned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re coming down
with something, for sure. Get home as fast as you
can, Chips, and into bed! Have your mother call a
doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us worry about that. You beat it home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Within an hour, the Cubs knew the worst. Chips
had a mild case of the measles! He would be out of
the game and confined to his home for more than a
week.</p>
<p>The Cubs were too discouraged even to discuss
the situation. Chub now would have to go into the
game as a forward. That meant that Dan would be
shifted to guard, given the task of trying to hold
Pat to a minimum of baskets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re sunk,&rdquo; he admitted privately to Brad as
they laced their tennis shoes in the dressing room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably,&rdquo; the Den Chief agreed. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s do our
best though. And if we&rsquo;re licked, let&rsquo;s take it like
good sports.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An even larger crowd had gathered in the gymnasium
than for the first game of the series. Fred
jubilantly reported that despite a poor advance
ticket sale, thirty-seven dollars had been taken in at
the door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One man paid a dollar,&rdquo; he told the Cubs. &ldquo;Said
he wanted to help with the organization&rsquo;s defense
fund.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we have to give Pat and his chislers half of
the receipts!&rdquo; Red remarked bitterly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unfair!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In glancing over the audience, Dan noticed many
neighbors and other persons he knew. However, on
the front row he observed a tall, thin man rather
poorly dressed, whose face he did not recognize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; Dan asked Brad, pointing out the
stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one I ever saw before. I don&rsquo;t think he was
here last game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See how he keeps watching Chub,&rdquo; Dan directed
the other&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;I guess it must be because the
kid&rsquo;s so unsure of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chub does his best, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know that. I wasn&rsquo;t criticising him. It&rsquo;s not
his fault he was thrust into this game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs were convinced that without Chips to
bolster their team, they would be whitewashed.
However, each player was determined not to give
up without a struggle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>Sharp at seven o&rsquo;clock the whistle sounded and
the game began. The Cubs were heartened by the
arrival, albeit late, of Mr. Hatfield. Having come
directly from a train, he still had his suitcase with
him.</p>
<p>Both teams played cautiously at the start of the
game. Pat and the other members of his team evidently
were determined not to be tripped up on
rules a second time.</p>
<p>To avoid personal fouls, the Purple Five boys
quite outdid themselves. Once when Pat brushed
hard against Dan as they both rushed for the ball,
the Bay Shore boy actually muttered: &ldquo;Excuse me,
I didn&rsquo;t mean to hit you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surprisingly, with roughness eliminated, the Cubs
held their own fairly well. Pat made two baskets,
and then was unable to score as Dan kept hard on
him.</p>
<p>Repeatedly, the Cubs had chances for baskets
themselves. Team plays worked well, even without
Chips. But Chub fumbled time after time at the
critical moment. Once he shot and the ball hung on
the rim, only to drop outside.</p>
<p>The half finally ended: 6 to 2 in favor of the Purple
Five.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If we only had you in there as forward, Dan,&rdquo;
Brad said regretfully. &ldquo;Chub tries, but he just can&rsquo;t
find the basket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the second half, Fred was put in as a substitute
for Chub. He and Midge, between them,
managed three baskets. In the last quarter, Dan
from far down the floor made a wild pass for the netting.
The ball looped high and with a swishing
sound, dropped cleanly through the mesh.</p>
<p>That brought the score: 6 to 6. Likewise, it aroused
the Purple Five. Bearing down, they began to
play roughly again. Foul after foul was chalked
against the Bay Shore players. Each time, when a
free throw was allowed, the Cubs&rsquo; failed to make the
single point.</p>
<p>Pat had become chained lightning itself. He
eluded Dan and time after time dropped the ball
close, if not through the basket. When the final
whistle blew, the score stood: 10 to 6 in favor of the
Purple Five.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried, but I couldn&rsquo;t hold Pat down,&rdquo; Dan confessed,
as he sank down on a bench to catch his
breath.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You did fine, Dan,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said, throwing
an arm around his shoulder. &ldquo;I was proud of you.
And of all the Cubs. Except for a few minutes toward
the end, it was a good, clean game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cubs hid their disappointment over loss of
the game. They congratulated the Purple Five on
the victory, and Dan made a point of speaking to
Pat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just too good,&rdquo; he said with a grin. &ldquo;It
takes a better guard than Dan Carter to hold you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat seemed surprised by the praise. &ldquo;You were
pretty fair yourself,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I missed a lot of
baskets because of good guarding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chips may be back for the third and deciding
game of the series,&rdquo; Dan went on. &ldquo;Now that both
teams have a victory, that contest should be a
honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hot cocoa was being served the Cubs upstairs in
the church dining room. Mr. Hatfield invited Pat
and his teammates to join the other boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; Pat answered, looking rather embarrassed.
&ldquo;I-I guess we won&rsquo;t. Next time, maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll count out your share of the receipts&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Skip it,&rdquo; Pat growled. He moved quickly away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>In leaving the gymnasium, Dan saw Chub talking
to the strange man who earlier had drawn his attention.
As he came up, the two separated. Chub waited
for him, his face troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything wrong, Chub?&rdquo; Dan inquired.</p>
<p>Chub shook his head. &ldquo;Only that I lost the game
for the Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such thing,&rdquo; Dan said cheerfully. &ldquo;Was it your
fault Chips came down with the measles? Anyhow,
I thought you played your very best game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; Chub brightened. &ldquo;I tried awfully
hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else bothering you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that man&mdash;he was asking me such funny
questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed him during the game,&rdquo; Dan returned.
&ldquo;He paid a lot of attention to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gave me a queer feeling, talking to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer? How so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chub shrugged and could not explain. &ldquo;He kept
calling me Charles for one thing, just as if he knew
me well. I never saw him before, but I had the
strangest feeling as if I&rsquo;d really known him a long
while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you his name?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, but he asked me a dozen questions. He
wanted to know where I lived, the school I attended&mdash;everything.
The last question was the funniest of
all. He said: &lsquo;Chub, are you <i>happy</i> here in Webster
City?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you tell him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t answer. You came up just then, and he
went off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let it bother you, Chub,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;The
guy must have been a screw-ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was real nice, Dan. I&mdash;I liked him ever so
much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t keep your mind on it,&rdquo; Dan said,
linking arms with the boy and pulling him toward
the stairway. &ldquo;Come on, let&rsquo;s have some hot cocoa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chub went willingly enough. In fact, as they entered
the dining room together, he failed to notice
that the stranger still loitered in the outside vestibule.</p>
<p>Dan however, had seen him. He observed too that
the man&rsquo;s gaze was following Chub&rsquo;s every move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can he be?&rdquo; he speculated. &ldquo;Why is he so
interested in Chub?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>Dan gave himself a mental memo to try during
the next few days to learn more about the stranger.
Meanwhile, why let it bother him? Following his
advice to Chub, he brushed the matter entirely from
his mind, and joined the other Cubs at the cocoa
table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">CHAPTER 16</span>
<br />THE STRANGER</h2>
<p>It was reassuring to learn that Chips had a very
light case of measles. The Cubs, of course, were not
permitted to see him. But Mrs. Davis reported to
the den that her son could not be kept in bed and
that his spots rapidly were disappearing.</p>
<p>Knowing that they all had been exposed to the
disease, the Cubs kept their fingers crossed. Days
passed however, and no other den member came
down sick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chips may be able to play in that last game with
the Purple Five,&rdquo; Dan remarked one day as he and
Brad walked to the public library together. &ldquo;Think
we have a chance to win?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With Chips, yes. We need him badly though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chub never will make a good player that&rsquo;s for
sure,&rdquo; Dan sighed. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t figure out that kid, Brad.
He likes being a Cub, but somehow he doesn&rsquo;t
catch on.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not at basketball,&rdquo; Brad admitted. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s
bothering him. Say, come to think of it, he hasn&rsquo;t
been at practice the last two nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s down with measles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never thought of that,&rdquo; Brad admitted. &ldquo;We
ought to find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys returned several books to the library
and then decided to hike out to Chub&rsquo;s place to inquire.</p>
<p>In response to their rap on the door the Widow
Lornsdale came to admit them. She assured them
that Chub was quite well, though not at home just
then.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be off somewhere wandering in the
woods,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Poor lad! He seems so lonesome
and unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he like being a Cub?&rdquo; Dan inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed, he enjoys the organization very
much. You know, though, that Chub&rsquo;s lot hasn&rsquo;t been
an easy one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad and Dan had no knowledge whatsoever of
the boy&rsquo;s past. Remembering Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s admonition
not to ask questions, they never had tried to
pry into his background.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done what I could for Chub,&rdquo; the widow
resumed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a very good boy and deserves parents.
Since Juvenile Court authorities placed him
with me, I&rsquo;ve had no trouble with him whatsoever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan and Brad were startled by the reference to
Juvenile Court. Was it possible, they wondered,
that Chub had at some time been a delinquent? It
hardly seemed possible that anyone so shy and reserved
could have given the authorities difficulty.</p>
<p>Thinking back, Dan recalled that the Juvenile
Court director had spoken to Chub when the Cubs
were touring the courthouse. Other referees there
had seemed to know him too. Yet Chub never once
had mentioned knowing any of the officials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you boys come inside and wait?&rdquo; the
widow politely invited them. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you when
Chub will return though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just tell him we were here,&rdquo; Brad directed. &ldquo;We
wanted to be sure he wasn&rsquo;t down with measles.
Tell him we&rsquo;ll be counting on him for the game
Friday night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give him your message,&rdquo; the widow promised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>Dusk was coming on as Brad and Dan turned
homeward. The old Christian Church, as usual, drew
them like a magnet. Though they might have chosen
a shorter route, deliberately they selected the road
which ran past the deserted building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never did learn what scared Pat and his
bunch Halloween night,&rdquo; Brad remarked, staring
at the dark, unwinking windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to talk to him about it,&rdquo; Dan admitted.
&ldquo;He closed up like a clam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since that night when the two nearly had caught
the Bay Shore boys in the building, Brad had discussed
the matter only once with Mr. Hatfield.
He never had given the Cub leader full information,
for their conversation had been interrupted by the
arrival of a third party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sure wish I knew what it was that scared Pat
half out of his wits,&rdquo; he remarked meditatively.
&ldquo;For half a cent&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not thinking of going in there?&rdquo; Dan
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o, not now, anyway. I&rsquo;d like to know, though,
if the door to the coal chute still is unlocked. Anyone
can get in and out of that building at will, and
yet the Cubs are blamed for any damage done!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>Cutting across the church lawn, the two circled
around to the rear of the property. Brad checked
the coal chute door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still unlocked,&rdquo; he reported in disgust.</p>
<p>Dan had been trying the doors. One which opened
into a rear corridor, swung inward at his touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the limit!&rdquo; he exploded. &ldquo;Why any
amount of damage could be done here! The place
is wide open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet Terry puts out he&rsquo;s such a good caretaker!
How those church trustees can claim to have any
case against the Cubs is beyond me! It&rsquo;s queer
though&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the place being open? Old Terry locked
the building up tight as a drum that first day he was
here with the trustees. I saw him check the doors
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose someone else could have a
key?&rdquo; Brad speculated. &ldquo;That is, someone besides
the trustees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan did not answer. He stood peering in through
the door he had shoved open. The old building was
as quiet as a tomb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This would be the perfect chance to make a
last check of the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were in the building once, Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the belfry. I&rsquo;d like to find out what makes
that bell tap so mysteriously. If we could learn the
answer, it might clear up the case against the Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if we were caught, or even seen, what
then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a chance we&rsquo;d have to take, Brad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Hatfield would like it,&rdquo; the Den
chief said, deeply troubled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as curious as you
are, but it&rsquo;s trespassing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs already are in the soup,&rdquo; Dan argued.
&ldquo;Unless we dig up some evidence that will help us,
the trustees will carry out their threat to file suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re right about that,&rdquo; Brad acknowledged.
&ldquo;If you want to wait here, I&rsquo;ll make a fast
foray in to see what I can learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Dan retorted. &ldquo;It was my
idea, so I&rsquo;m the one to go in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll both go,&rdquo; Brad decided suddenly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
safer that way. Let&rsquo;s be quick about it, and cautious.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>Having made up their minds, the boys stepped
inside the hallway, closing the door behind them.
The silence of the empty building was disturbing.
Into their thoughts came a recollection that upon
their last visit here, a door had been mysteriously
locked.</p>
<p>Dan could feel his heart pounding against his
ribs. He was scared, and unashamed of it.</p>
<p>Although it was still daylight, the musty church
interior already was shrouded in shadow. Every
cracked marble pillar stood out in the dim light as
a fearful sentinel.</p>
<p>Dan nervously tested the door through which they
had entered to make certain that it had not locked
behind them.</p>
<p>Satisfied that the exit remained free, he then
followed Brad deeper into the church.</p>
<p>A-tiptoe, the pair moved toward the iron stairway
leading up to the belfry. The treads, they noted,
were remarkably free of dust, though it lay heavy
elsewhere. Cobwebs festooned other ironwork in
the corridor.</p>
<p>Dan grasped the railing and began the steep ascent.
His chest felt constricted. His breath became
short, and he knew it wasn&rsquo;t from exertion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>Mid-way up to the tower, the boy halted to listen.
Brad, pressing close behind, also became alert.</p>
<p>Neither had heard any disturbing sound. Yet they
both sensed that they would run into something,
once they turned the next curve in the stairway.</p>
<p>Dan waited as long as he dared, and then crept
on. Another step. Two, three, four.</p>
<p>Nearing the top now, he could feel a rush of cool
air on his face.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Dan was brought up short. Above him,
in the belfry, he had heard a scraping sound, as if
a heavy object had been pulled across the floor.</p>
<p>Brad too, stiffened. Afraid even to whisper, the
boys huddled together, listening. From time to time
they could hear slight movements in the belfry.
Once they thought someone gave a deep sigh.</p>
<p>Finally, Dan gathered his courage, and moved
up another step. The bend in the stairway now lay
directly ahead. Once that point was passed, they
would have a clear view of the belfry.</p>
<p>With Brad at his elbow, Dan negotiated the last
few feet. Stunned by what he saw, he gripped the
iron railing with both hands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>The great bell hung in the turret, its dark clapper
motionless. Beyond the hollow metallic vessel, almost
at the edge of its flaring mouth, was a bed of
blankets!</p>
<p>As Dan&rsquo;s gaze fixed upon the bedding, he beheld
the figure of a drowsing man. The fellow stirred
sleepily, yawned and sat up.</p>
<p>It was then that both Cubs saw his face clearly.
The occupant of the belfry was none other than the
poorly dressed stranger who had paid such marked
attention to Chub at the basketball game!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">CHAPTER 17</span>
<br />A WITNESS</h2>
<p>The gaunt looking man in the belfry seemed unaware
of the Cubs&rsquo; presence on the iron stairway.</p>
<p>Wrapped in heavy blankets, he sat with his back
to the rim of the big bell. His feet rested comfortably
on a stone ledge of the tower. He gazed lazily
into space, absorbed by his own reverie.</p>
<p>As Dan and Brad huddled together, watching,
the man presently shifted his position. His shoulder
brushed against the bell, causing the clapper to
swing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drat it!&rdquo; the man exclaimed impatiently. He
seized the striker to prevent it from sounding. Having
steadied the bell, he again settled down into his
blankets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>The mystery surrounding the old church now
had been partially solved. Dan and Brad could not
guess the stranger&rsquo;s identity, but they were fairly
certain he had been living in the belfry for days,
perhaps weeks.</p>
<p>No imagination was required to explain the previous
strange tapping of the bell and Pat&rsquo;s terror on
Halloween night. The Bay Shore boys likely had
seen this man in the belfry and had mistaken him
for a ghost!</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s lips cracked into a grin at recollection of
how Pat and his cronies had fled from the building.
It really had been funny!</p>
<p>A bat came whirring down the well of the stairway,
swooping close to the boys. Dan nearly lost
his grasp on the spiral railing.</p>
<p>Involuntarily, he uttered a choked cry as he
cringed back. Slight as was the sound, it reached
the ears of the man in the belfry above.</p>
<p>Throwing off his blankets, he leaped to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; he demanded, peering down.</p>
<p>The daylight above seemed to have blinded him,
for he did not immediately see the two boys crouching
in the semi-darkness. But they could not escape
detection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up out of there!&rdquo; he ordered, as he made
out their shadowy forms. &ldquo;A couple of kids, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>Brad and Dan were nervous as they faced the
stranger. The wind had blown his dark hair and he
was unshaven. His eyes, however, had a friendly
twinkle which slightly reassured them. They were
relieved too, to note that he did not appear to be
armed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well! A couple of curious Cubs,&rdquo; the man
said cheerfully. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve finally caught me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already Dan and Brad had lost their fear of the
stranger. He was a man of early middle age, well-built
and deeply tanned from having lived an outdoor
life. Why, they wondered, had he chosen the
church belfry for his home?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been living here a long while, haven&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; Dan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been sleeping here off and on about three
weeks,&rdquo; the stranger shrugged. &ldquo;This place, I&rsquo;m
telling you, isn&rsquo;t very cozy now that the nights are
so cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you have slept in the church, instead
of in this bird roost?&rdquo; Brad asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, some nights I do.&rdquo; The stranger had gathered
up his army blankets and was folding them neatly.
&ldquo;I stay up here because I like the cool, clean air. I
can sleep anywhere. Learned it in the army. Up here
I don&rsquo;t have to keep an eye out all the time for that
pest, Terry the Terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The church caretaker?&rdquo; Dan asked, smiling at
the nickname.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, he&rsquo;s always checking up, but never did
tumble to the fact that he had a non-paying renter
in his building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you anyhow?&rdquo; Dan asked bluntly.
&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t we see you the other night at the basketball
game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was there, son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell us your name,&rdquo; Dan reminded
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; The man smiled as he ran a hand over
his stubbly two-day-old beard. &ldquo;Would you take me
for a tramp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not exactly.&rdquo; Dan scarcely knew how to classify
the stranger. He spoke excellent English and had
certain refinements that one usually did not associate
with a tramp. Yet obviously, the fellow was
without funds or he wouldn&rsquo;t be living in the belfry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must excuse my appearance,&rdquo; the man
said. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to get to my barber
yet today.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>Picking up a knapsack from the stone floor, he
began to take out toilet articles&mdash;a razor, a mirror
and shaving cream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know you have no right to be living here,&rdquo;
Brad burst out. &ldquo;How did you get in, anyhow?
Through the coal chute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did the first time. After that, I used the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this church was supposed to be locked.
Terry checks on the place, or at least he&rsquo;s supposed
to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The caretaker&rsquo;s a nice old codger, but not very
alert. If he had been, he&rsquo;d never have left a key lying
around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found it?&rdquo; Brad questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may not have been his,&rdquo; the stranger admitted.
&ldquo;I came upon it the day I holed in here. Found it
lying on a window sill, and discovered it unlocked
one of the doors. So I&rsquo;ve used it ever since. Convenient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terry probably was afraid to admit to the trustees
that he had lost one of his keys!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed.
&ldquo;Say, he could have cleared up a lot of things for
our Den, if he&rsquo;d acted right!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>No longer uneasy in the stranger&rsquo;s presence, the
two boys now plied him with eager questions. Did
he live in the belfry because he had no money? How
long had he been in Webster City?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fire &rsquo;em at me so fast,&rdquo; the man chuckled.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been out of the army very long. I have a
little money, but I&rsquo;m trying to make it last until I
get a certain job I&rsquo;m after. Besides, I have another
little matter here in Webster City&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hatfield probably could help you find work,&rdquo;
Brad offered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s our Cub leader.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll find work all right, son. Fact is, I don&rsquo;t plan
on staying in this town very long. Not unless&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless what?&rdquo; Brad caught him up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it depends on a certain matter. My own
private affairs.&rdquo; Deliberately, the man changed the
subject. &ldquo;Tell me about the Cubs,&rdquo; he requested.
&ldquo;Do you like the organization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best in the world,&rdquo; Dan said proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you have a boy in your den by the name
of Chub?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Dan agreed. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s new. You must know
him. I saw you talking to him the other night at
the basketball game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a lot like my own son. I had a boy once.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; Dan murmured. He remained silent, reflecting
that in appearance Chub might have been
related to this stranger. Although the color of their
hair and eyes was different, the contour of their
faces was much the same. A coincidence, of course.
But why was this man so interested in Chub?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind telling you about myself,&rdquo; the man
said after a long hesitation. &ldquo;First of all, I have no
criminal record. I&rsquo;ve stolen nothing and broken no
law, except that I&rsquo;ve trespassed on this property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could be arrested for that,&rdquo; Brad reminded
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; the man admitted. &ldquo;I figured that
sooner or later I&rsquo;d be caught here. I&rsquo;ll move out today.
I&rsquo;d hoped to stay a little longer&mdash;but never
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should tell us your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should,&rdquo; the man agreed. &ldquo;Just call me Mr.
Smith. When the right time comes, you&rsquo;ll learn my
true name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad and Dan were becoming more confused
each moment. They liked the friendly stranger, but
could not understand why he acted so mysteriously.
If he had no criminal record, why should he hesitate
to reveal his name?</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened Halloween night?&rdquo; Dan asked
curiously. &ldquo;You must have played ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>Mr. Smith laughed aloud at the recollection. &ldquo;I
heard those boys speaking up the stairway,&rdquo; he
revealed. &ldquo;I waited until they were nearly in the
belfry. Then I popped out with a blanket over my
face. I made moaning sounds and wild gestures.
Those kids bolted out of here like a streak of
lightning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From time to time, we&rsquo;ve heard the bell tap,&rdquo;
Dan went on. &ldquo;Were you responsible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid I&rsquo;ll have to plead guilty. Once when the
kids were here, I hit the bell by accident. The other
times I tapped it on purpose. I didn&rsquo;t want to scare
the kids too much&mdash;only wanted to keep them from
playing around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad had been gazing thoughtfully at the stranger,
thinking hard. If the man had lived in the
belfry for three weeks, he must have observed a
great many persons come and go. No wonder he
seemed personally acquainted with the members of
Den 2!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan and I came here for a purpose today,&rdquo; he
suddenly disclosed. &ldquo;You may have heard the talk
in Webster City about the Cubs causing trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did pick up a few rumors.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been accused of doing a lot of damage
here,&rdquo; Brad went on. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that to be a fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo; Brad, in his eagerness, grasped the
stranger&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Could you help us? That is, what
I&rsquo;m trying to ask&mdash;did you see anything that would
help us? Do you know who really did the damage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; the man returned. &ldquo;I saw the Cubs come
here that first day with their basketball. You kids
smashed a window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was all the damage we did though,&rdquo; Dan
declared. &ldquo;We were accused of doing a great deal
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cub honor is at stake,&rdquo; Brad added. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
do anything to prove our innocence! We think we
know who did the damage, but we have no proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger gazed down into the tense, worried
faces of the Cubs. His smile was reassuring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a soft spot in my heart for the Cubs,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;I want to help the organization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you?&rdquo; pleaded Dan. &ldquo;Do you know the
boys who damaged this place?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A gang showed up here about a half hour after
the Cubs broke that window. They went through
the place and really wrecked it. I saw their faces
quite clearly. The ring leader, in particular, I could
identify.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat Oswald?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know his name. He&rsquo;s captain of the
Purple Five basketball team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Pat!&rdquo; Dan cried. He was so excited he no
longer could control his voice. &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Smith, you
must come with us right away to see the church
trustees! If only we can make them believe the
truth, the Cubs&rsquo; name will be cleared!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">CHAPTER 18</span>
<br />A JOLT FOR PAT</h2>
<p>Dan and Brad both were excited as the realization
came to them that at least they had a means
of establishing the innocence of the Cubs!</p>
<p>Until now, though they had been morally certain
that Pat Oswald and his gang were the real
culprits, they had known of no way to prove it.</p>
<p>But a witness miraculously had appeared! The
mysterious &ldquo;Mr. Smith&rdquo; could, if he chose, speak
the words which would clear Den 2. Would he
agree to tell what he knew and had seen from the
belfry?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come with us?&rdquo; Dan repeated his plea.
&ldquo;Please, will you help the Cubs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to, son,&rdquo; the man replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come with us now,&rdquo; Brad urged. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
take you directly to the church trustees.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not be too hasty,&rdquo; Mr. Smith said. &ldquo;If I
tell what I know, I&rsquo;ll have to explain how I happened
to be roosting here. That could be awkward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to help the Cubs, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Dan
pleaded. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it only right that the truth should be
known?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The truth will come out,&rdquo; Mr. Smith promised
the boys. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a matter of timing though. I have to
think of my own interests. I&rsquo;m here in Webster City
for a special purpose. If I should tell now that I&rsquo;ve
been living in this belfry&mdash;well, it might jeopardize
everything I&rsquo;m after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you won&rsquo;t go with us to the trustees?&rdquo; Brad
asked, bitterly disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not put it that way, son. I want to help. I
will too. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I can identify the boys who
damaged this church. The point is, I&rsquo;d like to postpone
the dramatic announcement for a day or two.
Wouldn&rsquo;t that be okay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Brad admitted reluctantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting out of this place right away,&rdquo; the
stranger continued. &ldquo;As soon as I can pick up mail
at the Post Office, I&rsquo;ll see a certain party. Then, it
may be I&rsquo;ll be in a position to help you. Or there
may be a few days delay.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Brad and Dan could not make up their minds
that they were not being &ldquo;stalled.&rdquo; Mr. Smith seemed
sincere, yet how could they be sure he merely was
not trying to fool them. Once they parted from him,
they might never see him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will we know where to find you?&rdquo; Dan
asked dubiously. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t come back here or we&rsquo;ll
be accused of breaking in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay here any longer either,&rdquo; the stranger
declared. &ldquo;Tell you what! When is your next basketball
game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friday night,&rdquo; Brad informed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you at the church gymnasium then. That
will give me a few days to wind up my business
here. Also, I&rsquo;ll be on hand to identify that boy you
call Pat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that might work out all right!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed.
&ldquo;But how do we know you&rsquo;ll keep your
promise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to accept my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad and Dan knew that they had no choice.
They could not force the stranger to accompany
them to see the church trustees. If they reported
the man to police, undoubtedly he would disappear
before they could return to his hide-out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not fail you,&rdquo; the man promised, smiling as if
he had read their thoughts. &ldquo;Just one favor. You&rsquo;re
to tell no one that you have seen me here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not even our Cub leader?&rdquo; Dan asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two boys hesitated, reluctant to give such a
binding promise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll agree to come to the game Friday night,&rdquo;
Mr. Smith went on, &ldquo;but only upon condition that
you keep my secret until then. How about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; Brad said unwillingly. Dan too
nodded his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cub&rsquo;s honor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cub&rsquo;s honor,&rdquo; Dan repeated. &ldquo;We won&rsquo;t tell anyone
about seeing you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know I can trust you boys,&rdquo; the stranger said.
He had gathered up a few belongings, and was
stuffing them into a bag. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so bewildered.
Everything will be explained in good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I&rsquo;d like to know right now,&rdquo;
Brad said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe you can clear up the mystery of
how the ice cream freezers were delivered to the
Cubs. Did you see Pat Oswald and his bunch take
them from the basement here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>Mr. Smith busied himself polishing his scuffed
shoes with an old rag. He kept smiling to himself,
apparently enjoying his own secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know all about those freezers!&rdquo; Brad accused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us how they happened to be delivered to
us!&rdquo; Dan requested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was like this,&rdquo; Mr. Smith said. &ldquo;I overheard
the Cubs talking about needing a couple of
freezers. Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t have done it, but I dug
&rsquo;em out of the basement here, and left them at the
church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly put us in a spot,&rdquo; Brad informed
him. &ldquo;We had a swell time making the ice cream,
but Terry Treuhaft came looking for those freezers.
He would have made a fearful fuss, only as it happened,
we didn&rsquo;t have &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&mdash;we suspect Pat and his bunch&mdash;had
swiped them,&rdquo; Dan explained, grinning at the recollection.</p>
<p>Now that the incident was half-way forgotten,
his resentment at Pat gradually was fading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have done it,&rdquo; Mr. Smith admitted.
&ldquo;But no one was using those freezers. The Cubs
needed &rsquo;em. So I thought I&rsquo;d do them a friendly
turn.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re certainly all for the Cubs,&rdquo; Dan said,
studying the stranger curiously. &ldquo;Is it because of
Chub?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I took a shine to the youngster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Smith had finished picking up his toilet articles.
Now that his hair was combed, his clothing
brushed, he looked entirely presentable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; Dan said abruptly, &ldquo;you look a lot
like Chub. Same eyes&mdash;hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; agreed Brad, startled by Dan&rsquo;s
observation. &ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re a relative!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I am,&rdquo; the man admitted. &ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;m a
close relative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not his father?&rdquo; Dan guessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, his father,&rdquo; the stranger repeated, almost
defiantly. &ldquo;Anything wrong with it? You think he&rsquo;d
be ashamed if he knew the truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; Dan stammered. &ldquo;Why should he
be ashamed of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;ve neglected him all these years,&rdquo; the
man burst out. &ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m living in this belfry
instead of in a decent house or hotel, the way other
folks do. Because I have no job! Because if folks
knew I was Chub&rsquo;s father they&rsquo;d say I was no good.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not if it weren&rsquo;t true,&rdquo; Dan answered quietly.
&ldquo;Chub&rsquo;s terribly lonesome. He needs a Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One that he could be proud of,&rdquo; the man answered
in a bitter voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s better that I go away
and never tell him the truth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that be fair to Chub?&rdquo; Brad asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might be the kindest thing I could do. He has
a good home here. I&rsquo;ve checked into that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chub has a good home,&rdquo; Dan agreed, &ldquo;but he
isn&rsquo;t happy. He&rsquo;s always mooning around, not talking
much, but sort of wrapped in his own thoughts.
He needs a Dad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your name isn&rsquo;t Smith,&rdquo; Brad took up the discussion.
&ldquo;Is it Weldon, the same as Chub&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. He doesn&rsquo;t know who I am though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chub&rsquo;s father remained silent for some minutes.
Then, apparently having made up his mind to tell
the Cubs everything about himself, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things are coming to a head fast. I expect to
pull out of Webster City in a few days at the latest.
I haven&rsquo;t decided yet whether or not to tell Chub
that I&rsquo;m his father. Can I depend upon you boys
to keep the secret&mdash;at least for the time being?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Brad said at once.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t tell Chub unless you gave us permission,&rdquo;
Dan added. &ldquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t be square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My real name is Bruce Weldon,&rdquo; the man disclosed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not go too much into the past, except
to say that some years ago through no fault of my
own, I lost touch with Chub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; Brad inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, in a divorce proceeding, his custody was
awarded to my wife. Chub was only a baby then
and needed a mother to look after him. I sent money
regularly for his care. That is, I did until I was
wounded while serving at the front. For months, I
lay in a hospital, but through a mix-up of records,
I was reported missing in action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what happened?&rdquo; Dan asked, deeply interested
in the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eventually, I recovered and started checking
up. I learned then that my wife had died, and that
Chub had been placed in the home of one of her
friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I inquired there, I discovered that the
arrangement hadn&rsquo;t worked out well, and that he
had been shifted elsewhere. To make a long story
short, it took me nearly six months to trace Chub to
Webster City. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;d spent most of my
money, and I couldn&rsquo;t take a job, because I didn&rsquo;t
want to settle down until I found Chub.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now that you&rsquo;ve found him, why not tell him
who you are?&rdquo; Brad suggested. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t that
straighten everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that simple,&rdquo; Mr. Weldon replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
made a contact with Juvenile Court authorities, but
the director isn&rsquo;t satisfied it would be for Chub&rsquo;s
best interests to let me have him again. You see, it
hinges on my ability to support him. I know I can
get a good job and keep it too, but the court demands
proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you talked to Mr. Greene?&rdquo; Dan questioned.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s real nice and might help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know Mr. Greene very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he knows about Chub too,&rdquo; Dan said,
recalling the visit of the Cubs to Juvenile Court.
&ldquo;Gee, it was sort of funny! I actually thought Chub
might have been in trouble with the court, because
everyone there seemed to be acquainted with him.
It was only because they were looking out for his
rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chub never was in trouble in his life,&rdquo; Mr. Weldon
said proudly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a mighty good youngster,
bright in school too. Mr. Greene assured me of that.
His only problem is that he isn&rsquo;t very happy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Being a Cub though, has helped,&rdquo; Brad said.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s more sure of himself, and he hardly ever
stutters any more unless he&rsquo;s excited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Weldon nodded and made the boys a promise.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always stick up for the Den 2 boys. You
know why? They were kind to Chub and didn&rsquo;t
tease him. Now about cleaning up those accusations
against the Cubs. Shall we do it on the night
of the basketball game?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be the best time,&rdquo; Brad agreed.
&ldquo;How will we arrange it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to me,&rdquo; said Mr. Weldon confidently.
&ldquo;Just have Mr. Greene attend the game, and if possible
the trustees of this church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em there, if I have to give them free
tickets to the game!&rdquo; Dan chortled. &ldquo;Wow! What
a sockaroo Pat Oswald has in store! Even if he and
his gang win that Friday game, they&rsquo;re going to get
the jolt of their lives!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">CHAPTER 19</span>
<br />CUB HONOR</h2>
<p>The church gymnasium was jammed with spectators.
Every seat had been taken ten minutes in
advance of the scheduled game between the Cubs
and the Purple Five. Now, crouched in a tight little
knot at one end of the floor, the Den 2 boys were
awaiting the starting signal.</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s gaze roved over the audience. In the front
row not far from where his own parents sat, he
sighted both Mr. Maxwell and Mr. Brennan.</p>
<p>He heaved a sigh of relief. Actually, he hadn&rsquo;t
dared hope that the church trustees would attend
the game, even though he had mailed them tickets.</p>
<p>Dan&rsquo;s searching eyes traveled on through row
upon row of spectators. Toward the back of the
gymnasium, he saw Mr. Greene, the Juvenile Court
director, and another court official he did not know
by name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone&rsquo;s here,&rdquo; he whispered jubilantly.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone except Mr. Weldon,&rdquo; Brad replied and
his voice was tense with worry. &ldquo;What if he doesn&rsquo;t
show up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He promised, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, but we haven&rsquo;t seen him since that day
in the belfry. Maybe he&rsquo;s skipped town. Tell you the
truth, Dan, I&rsquo;m jittery. If he doesn&rsquo;t come to identify
Pat, what&rsquo;ll we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; Dan said.</p>
<p>Though he spoke confidently, he too shared the
older boy&rsquo;s uneasiness. Twice since the two had
seen Mr. Weldon in the church belfry, they had returned
to seek him. They had found only a locked,
and apparently deserted church. The stranger who
had claimed to be Chub&rsquo;s father, obviously had
moved out immediately after his meeting with
them. Had he left Webster City? They had no way
of knowing, but they had not once seen him on the
street.</p>
<p>As for the game itself, feeling was running high.
The greater percentage of rooters seemed to favor
the Cubs, but one section of the gymnasium was
jammed with friends of Pat and the Bay Shore boys.
Dan wondered how they would take a loss of the
game, or a disclosure that the Purple Five team
was wanted in Juvenile Court.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sort of sorry for Pat,&rdquo; he remarked privately
to Dan. &ldquo;The guy doesn&rsquo;t have a suspicion of
what&rsquo;s going to happen to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuming that Mr. Weldon shows up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat isn&rsquo;t such a bad sort when you get to know
him,&rdquo; Dan went on. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a show off, of course, and
full of mischief. He&rsquo;s quieted down a lot though
lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conscience hurting you, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such thing! If Pat and his bunch wrecked
that old Christian Church, then it&rsquo;s only right that
they take their medicine. I&rsquo;m not forgetting that
they let the blame fall on the Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brad glanced nervously at the wall clock. &ldquo;Three
more minutes until game time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I only hope
the Cubs win! It&rsquo;s terribly important, because if
Pat&rsquo;s team wins, and then everything breaks wide
open, they may accuse us of putting the finger on
&rsquo;em to get even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not only Dan and Brad, but all of the Cubs were
exceedingly nervous. This third game in the series
was the deciding one. The Den 2 boys did not so
much mind losing, but they hoped that they would
play their best.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>The line-up however, was discouraging. Chips,
although out of quarantine, had not been permitted
to play. He sat in the audience, beside Mr. Hatfield,
looking pale and dejected.</p>
<p>Brad would play center, as always. Red and
Midge were assigned as guards, while Dan and
Chub were forwards. That left only Fred as substitute,
which meant that the Cubs would have to
take care not to be put out on personal fouls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we only had Chips in the game, we&rsquo;d have a
chance at least,&rdquo; Brad confided to his friend. &ldquo;But
Chub&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s improved a lot this last week,&rdquo; Dan said
loyally. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been helping him every night after
school, teaching him a few tricks. He&rsquo;s pepped up
a great deal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that,&rdquo; Brad admitted, turning to
look at the younger boy, who even now was practicing
baskets. &ldquo;Do you suppose he could know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About his father? I&rsquo;ve wondered the same thing,
Brad. He hasn&rsquo;t dropped a word, but the last couple
of days he&rsquo;s seemed on fire. He&rsquo;s been so jolly and
so full of pep. I just hope he&rsquo;s that way tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>The sounding of a whistle warned the Cubs that
it was game time. They huddled together for a
last-minute conference, then trotted out to their
places on the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Cubs!&rdquo; yelled the Den 2 rooters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in there, Pat!&rdquo; shouted the Purple Five supporters.
&ldquo;Show &rsquo;em your stuff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The game started fast. The Purple Five had
elected to take the south basket in the first half.</p>
<p>As the Cubs fully expected, the Purple Five center
was inches taller than Brad. He out jumped his
opponent, and easily tapped the ball to Pat in the
first second of play.</p>
<p>Red though, was on his toes. He guarded Pat so
closely that he could not pass or shoot for the basket.
The referee tossed the ball between them. Red
out jumped his opponent, and sent the ball bouncing
toward Chub.</p>
<p>The boy missed it, but recovered. He hesitated,
uncertain what to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot it to Dan!&rdquo; shouted Chips from the sidelines.</p>
<p>Chub heard and hurled the ball. The shot was
wild, but Dan made a leap into the air and caught
it. The crowd roared with delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot! Shoot!&rdquo; screamed the Den 2 rooters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<p>The ball went smoothly from Dan&rsquo;s hands. It
made a high loop and with scarcely a sound, dropped
through the north basket.</p>
<p>The Cubs had scored two points in the first three
minutes of play!</p>
<p>Thrilled by their success, the Cubs tried harder
than ever for victory. However, the Purple Five
were not to be caught napping a second time. Pat
and his teammates began to play less cautiously,
always watching for a chance to shatter the defense
of the Cubs.</p>
<p>The Den 2 plays were working perfectly until the
ball reached Chub. Repeatedly, Brad or Midge fed
him the ball, only to have him muff the shot. Whenever
possible, they passed to Dan, but both Purple
Five guards concentrated on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They watch me like a hawk,&rdquo; Dan complained as
the two teams rested at the end of the first quarter.
&ldquo;If I could just get a free shot at that basket once
in a while!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The score stood 2 to 6 in favor of the Purple Five.
The Cubs truly were worried. Unless they dug in
fast, they&rsquo;d lose the game.</p>
<p>Chub touched Dan on the arm. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
put Fred in instead of me?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I&mdash;I try, but
I can&rsquo;t seem to find the basket.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>Dan slapped him on the back. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing
fine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Quit worrying and just think about
the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to do well tonight &rsquo;specially,&rdquo; Chub
said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone here watching me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan had forgotten entirely about Chub&rsquo;s father.
Now he saw the other boy turn and glance directly
at a man who stood at the end of the gymnasium
with a group of spectators who had arrived too late
to obtain seats.</p>
<p>So Mr. Weldon had kept his promise! Dan felt
a great load drop from his shoulders. What a surprise
Pat would get, when the game finally ended!</p>
<p>Dan saw Chub wave to his father, and noted the
happy light in the boy&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows the truth,&rdquo; Dan instantly decided.
&ldquo;Someone has told him. That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s trying so
hard tonight. He wants to make good for his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Mr. Hatfield came across the floor to
speak to Dan. Drawing him aside, he asked his
opinion about keeping Chub in the game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred doesn&rsquo;t particularly want to play,&rdquo; the Cub
leader said. &ldquo;Chub has missed a good many chances
to score though. If you take him out&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, try him awhile longer,&rdquo; Dan replied quickly.
&ldquo;Chub is playing better tonight than he ever did
before. Let him stay in. After all, winning isn&rsquo;t
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear you say that, Dan,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield
answered. &ldquo;This has been a good clean game
so far, and that&rsquo;s what counts. Excellent sportsmanship
on both sides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The game went on, and for a while the Cubs
played with renewed energy. Chub managed a basket
and the fans cheered madly.</p>
<p>But the next minute, Pat captured the ball. Before
Red could stop him, he dribbled down the
floor, cut in under the basket and scored.</p>
<p>Dan was annoyed at himself. He was playing
well but the Purple Five guards wouldn&rsquo;t give him
a chance. Time and again they deserted Chub entirely
to concentrate their attention on him.</p>
<p>Even so, he twice broke through and made spectacular
shots. At the end of the half the score stood
8 to 6, with the Purple Five leading by only one
basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may take &rsquo;em yet,&rdquo; Dan said grimly as he
rested with his teammates. &ldquo;Bear down, fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>Baskets were held to a minimum in the third
quarter. The players all were tiring. Mr. Hatfield
took Chub out of the game for awhile, substituting
Fred. When the Purple Five ran up two baskets in
quick succession, he called him to the bench and
let Chub go in again.</p>
<p>The Cubs truly were discouraged. With the score
at 12 to 6 it seemed to them they were sunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Cubs!&rdquo; the rooters pleaded. &ldquo;The old
fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan gritted his teeth and tried harder than ever.
He leaped for a high one, and fastening upon the
ball, ran full tilt into a Purple Five guard. He pivoted,
faked a pass to Chub, and dropped the ball
through the basket.</p>
<p>After that, playing as if inspired, he scored again.
Once he tangled briefly with a Purple Five guard,
and the referee called a personal foul on both
players. The Purple Five player missed the free
throw, while the Cubs again scored.</p>
<p>With less than a minute to play, the tally now
was: 12 to 11 in favor of the Purple Five.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One basket would do it,&rdquo; Dan thought desperately.
&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t snag it, we&rsquo;ll lose by a single
point.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>How much time was left? A minute at best.
Perhaps only seconds. Assured of victory, Pat and
his teammates were playing a delaying game. Without
trying to make another basket, they merely
sought to prevent a Cub from getting his hands on
the ball.</p>
<p>It seemed to the frantic Cubs that they couldn&rsquo;t
shatter the tight defense. Pat dribbled the ball lazily,
passing it to a player in the middle of the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in there! Break it up!&rdquo; Chips and Fred yelled
from the sidelines. &ldquo;Thirty seconds to play!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thirty seconds! Holy Mackerel, the game was
the same as over! Dan breathed heavily. He was
winded, and sick with the fear of defeat.</p>
<p>Only one basket was needed&mdash;only one.</p>
<p>Then Dan saw his chance. Still employing &ldquo;keep
it away&rdquo; tactics, Pat lazily passed the ball to the
forward who guarded Chub. The player missed the
catch and the ball rolled free.</p>
<p>Like a flash, Dan darted in and seized it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop him!&rdquo; Pat yelled.</p>
<p>Both guards were on Dan in an instant. They
boxed him in, making it impossible for him to have
an unobstructed shot for the basket.</p>
<p>Dan knew that he never could score. True, he
could make a wild shot, but it never would find its
mark.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>Chub, however, stood unguarded a little beyond
the center of the floor.</p>
<p>Dan passed the ball to him. Chub caught it
squarely, then hesitated.</p>
<p>Only a few seconds now remained. Dan saw the
time keeper starting to raise his hand in signal.
Another instant and the game would be over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot,&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;Shoot, Chub!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The younger Cub still seemed to hesitate. For a
dreadful moment, Dan thought that he intended to
try to pass the ball back.</p>
<p>Then, Chub took careful aim and attempted the
longest basket of his life. The ball looped high,
striking the backstop.</p>
<p>The Cub rooters groaned, certain that Chub had
missed. But the ball came down, striking the rim
of the basket.</p>
<p>There it teetered while the spectators as one, held
their breath. Then it dropped through the netting.</p>
<p>At the same moment, the game came to an end.
The score read: 13 to 12 in favor of the Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly, did I really make that basket?&rdquo; Chub demanded,
dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Dan and the other Cubs rushed over to clap him
on the back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You were swell!&rdquo; Brad assured him. &ldquo;You too,
Dan,&rdquo; he added warmly. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d tried to grandstand
that last shot yourself, the Cubs would have
lost. It was teamwork that saved the game!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chub&rsquo;s eyes sparkled with delight. &ldquo;Know something?&rdquo;
he confessed. &ldquo;When I made that last shot,
I-I closed my eyes. I was scared I&rsquo;d miss because I
always do on the long shots. So I just closed my
eyes and said a little prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter how you did it, the Cubs won!&rdquo; Dan
chuckled. &ldquo;I wonder how Pat and his boys will take
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Purple Five, discouraged by defeat, had
gathered in a little knot across the room. Pat could
be seen talking to the group very earnestly, but
what he might be saying the Cubs could not guess.</p>
<p>Chub, greatly excited, was unable to contain his
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;T-This was the biggest thrill of my l-life,&rdquo; he
declared. &ldquo;Did I really do all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swell,&rdquo; Red assured him patiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; Chub sighed. &ldquo;Being a Cub means so
much to me. But I&rsquo;ve never been able to carry my
end.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You did tonight,&rdquo; Dan said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a credit to
the team and to Den 2.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll remember that always,&rdquo; Chub replied soberly.</p>
<p>He slipped away then into the crowd. Dan saw
him join his father and they both went off together.</p>
<p>The crowd already was filing out of the gymnasium.
Brad came hurrying over to speak to Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, we must work fast!&rdquo; he announced breathlessly.
&ldquo;Mr. Greene and those church trustees are
leaving!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t do that until Mr. Weldon tells what
he knows!&rdquo; Dan exclaimed in dismay. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s supposed
to identify Pat and his bunch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re making a mess of it,&rdquo; Brad declared. &ldquo;This
was supposed to be our big moment, and what happens?
Everyone pulls out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stop Mr. Greene and the trustees,&rdquo; Dan directed.
&ldquo;Take them to the clubroom. I&rsquo;ll fetch Mr.
Weldon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Okay, but hurry,&rdquo; Brad advised.</p>
<p>Dan started off in search of Chub and his father.
He was annoyed at himself for having let them get
out of his sight. Now they seemed to have vanished
completely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<p>As he searched, Pat Oswald sought him, diffidently
offering his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Cubs played a dandy game,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
deserved to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, thanks,&rdquo; Dan replied, hiding his astonishment.</p>
<p>He shook Pat&rsquo;s hand and then felt suddenly almost
ashamed of himself. In another minute or two,
he&rsquo;d be accusing this same boy in front of Mr.
Greene and the church trustees. It didn&rsquo;t make
sense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything wrong?&rdquo; Pat asked curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty.&rdquo; Dan spoke in cold misery. But he
couldn&rsquo;t tell him the truth even then. This was the
hour the Cubs long had awaited. If he weakened
now, Den 2 might never clear its dishonored name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look sort of funny,&rdquo; Pat said, staring hard
at him. &ldquo;Guess you played too hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for Chub and
a man with him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have you seen them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They left the church together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Left the church?&rdquo; Dan repeated in disbelief.
&ldquo;Why, Chub hadn&rsquo;t even changed his clothes!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He slipped a pair of jeans over his shorts and
went that way. They must have been in an awful
hurry. The man just hustled him into a taxi and
off they went.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan stared at Pat, drinking in the words. Why,
it was incredible!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re telling me straight?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo; Pat grinned, and added impudently:
&ldquo;Cub&rsquo;s honor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan felt completely deflated. He knew without
checking that Pat had spoken the truth. For some
unknown reason, Mr. Weldon has hustled his son
away from the gymnasium. Deliberately, he had
welched on his promise to clear the Cubs! Now the
true story might never be disclosed publicly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you <i>are</i> sick,&rdquo; Pat said with concern. &ldquo;Anything
I can do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dumbly, Dan shook his head. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done it
already,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The Cubs lost everything they
valued tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; Pat said, looking puzzled. &ldquo;You
won the game, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a game? More than victory or anything
else, the Cubs cherished their good name in the
community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat stared at Dan a moment. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that got
to do with me?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think you know, I&rsquo;d hoped that tonight the
Cubs might clear themselves of the untruths that
have been told about them. Now I know that
chance is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With dignity, Dan turned and walked away from
Pat into the dressing room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">CHAPTER 20</span>
<br />PROOF</h2>
<p>In the clubroom, the Den mothers were serving
hot chocolate and home baked cookies to the Cubs
and their friends.</p>
<p>When Dan stepped into the room which buzzed
with conversation, he noted at once that the Bay
Shore boys had not accepted an invitation to share
refreshments. This was not surprising, for in previous
games Pat and his followers had left the building
immediately after the contest.</p>
<p>As he scanned the crowd, Brad and Midge came
over to speak to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Chub?&rdquo; the Den Chief asked
anxiously.</p>
<p>Before Dan could reveal what he knew, Brad
went on: &ldquo;Right after the game, he came to me
and thanked me for being nice to him. Said the
Cubs all had been swell, and he wanted me to tell
them so for him. I didn&rsquo;t think much about it at the
time. But now I&rsquo;m worried.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Chub&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone where, Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. But I have a hunch he&rsquo;s with his
father, and that we&rsquo;ll never see either of them
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan then related his own last meeting with Chub
and recounted Pat&rsquo;s report of seeing the two leave
the church together in a taxi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Weldon must have decided to skip town
and take Chub with him!&rdquo; Brad gasped. &ldquo;Gosh!
Where does that leave us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just where we came in.&rdquo; Dan spoke dejectedly.
&ldquo;Without Mr. Weldon, we can&rsquo;t prove a thing!
We&rsquo;re sunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked the church trustees and Mr. Greene up
here too,&rdquo; Brad groaned. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re talking to Mr.
Hatfield now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He jerked his head to indicate the chocolate table
where the four men stood. Mr. Greene had accepted
a cup of cocoa from one of the mothers. Mr. Maxwell
and Mr. Brennan, however, had refused the
refreshments.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<p>As Brad glanced in their direction, the Cub
leader motioned for the boys to join the group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brad,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said, &ldquo;Mr. Maxwell tells me
that he and Mr. Brennan received an urgent request
to come here tonight. Is it true someone told them
that evidence would be produced tonight to clear
the Cubs of charges against them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan sent the tickets,&rdquo; Brad said. &ldquo;I asked the
trustees up here. Dan and I did have the evidence,
but we can&rsquo;t produce it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So?&rdquo; Mr. Maxwell inquired. He began to put on
his gloves. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve wasted our time. I might have
known it was another Cub trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Dan burst out indignantly. &ldquo;The
Cubs never did damage your old church. We could
tell you who did do it, but we have no proof. Anyway,
you wouldn&rsquo;t believe us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Maxwell ignored Dan completely. He turned
to Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our attorney will file suit in the morning,&rdquo; he
announced. &ldquo;We have been very patient in trying
to make a settlement with the Scout organization.
Now we are tired of waiting. Good evening.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>He picked up his hat and started for the door.
Mr. Brennan, obviously embarrassed by such outspoken
words, hesitated and then followed.</p>
<p>Before the pair reached the door, it opened and
in poured Pat Oswald and all the Bay Shore boys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold it!&rdquo; Pat called out. &ldquo;Everybody listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan thought that the Purple Five players must
have come to collect their share of the game receipts.</p>
<p>Therefore, he was amazed when Pat pulled a
cloth bag from his jeans and shoved it at Mr. Hatfield.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the money from the first game,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, thanks, Pat,&rdquo; said the Cub leader. &ldquo;The
Cubs can use it, I guess, as we have a lawsuit to
fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; Pat announced. The
room was very still now and his voice seemed raspy.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve talked it over, and we want to make a clean
breast of everything. Then you can take us to jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, Pat,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield encouraged. &ldquo;What
is it you want to say?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t the Cubs who wrecked the old church,&rdquo;
the boy blurted out. &ldquo;We did it and they got the
blame. We saw a window smashed, so we smashed
another and climbed inside. We didn&rsquo;t mean to do
any real damage&mdash;we just didn&rsquo;t think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one spoke for a moment after Pat had made
his confession. Finally, Mr. Maxwell said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this does throw a different light on the
matter. But how do we know they&rsquo;re telling the
truth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t lie,&rdquo; Pat retorted scornfully. &ldquo;Anyhow,
why would we tell you this if it weren&rsquo;t so?
It only gets us into a peck o&rsquo; trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Greene, the Juvenile Court director, now
moved forward to face the church trustees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boy is telling the truth,&rdquo; he said quietly.
&ldquo;For weeks, our department has been making an
investigation. We weren&rsquo;t ready to make an announcement,
lacking absolute proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t it now, either,&rdquo; Mr. Maxwell snapped.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a personal friend of Mr. Hatfield, and
that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re siding with the Cubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The disclosure that Pat and his boys were responsible
for the damage had not pleased him. He
knew well enough that their parents were not well-to-do
and the boys themselves never would be able
to pay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>A silence fell upon the room. Then Mr. Hatfield&rsquo;s
voice rang out, clear and confident.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do have the proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His dramatic, confident statement electrified and
thrilled everyone. The Cubs scarcely could believe
that the wonderful words had been spoken. Why,
Mr. Hatfield never so much as hinted that he had
learned the truth! How had he come upon his information?</p>
<p>Flashing a confident smile, the Cub leader took
a long, fat envelope from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Documentary proof,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is a letter
from a man who was an eye-witness of what occurred
at the old church. Rather, it is a sworn statement
which he signed in the presence of witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not from Chub&rsquo;s father?&rdquo; Dan cried eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dan. The letter came to me late today. Mr.
Weldon and his son have left Webster City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For good?&rdquo; Red asked, sorry to hear the news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Chub will be back from time to time. His
father had obtained an excellent job in a city about
fifty miles from here. Mr. Greene, though, can tell
you more about that.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>The Juvenile Court director took up the report.
&ldquo;Chub has been a ward of the court for some time,&rdquo;
he informed the Cubs. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s never been happy
living in a foster home. When his real father claimed
him, we were glad to reunite them. However, we
had to be assured that Mr. Weldon could support
his son, before sanctioning the arrangement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now everything has been settled?&rdquo; Brad questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we gave Mr. Weldon permission today to
take his son. Chub wanted to play in the basketball
game, so they waited for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he come and say goodbye?&rdquo; Chips
demanded, hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can answer that,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield replied. &ldquo;He
was afraid he&rsquo;d break down if he stayed. Anyway
he and his father had to catch a train. He left a
note though, for the Cubs. We&rsquo;ll read it at a closed
meeting of the organization.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see that signed document,&rdquo; Mr. Maxwell
directed. &ldquo;The one you say was signed by an eye
witness to happenings at the old church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Hatfield offered him the sheet of paper which
bore a notary&rsquo;s seal. It was a document, the Cubs
knew, which would stand up in any court.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>In grim silence Mr. Maxwell read the statement.
Then he handed it over to Mr. Brennan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you must agree now that you have no
case against the Cubs,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mr. Maxwell admitted reluctantly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll drop our suit. But these other boys
ought to be locked up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Greene said in an even voice: &ldquo;If you insist
upon preferring charges, the court will consider
them. However, our investigation already has disclosed
that the building often was left unlocked.
Terry Treuhaft was not the most careful caretaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, someone ought to pay for the damage!&rdquo;
Mr. Maxwell muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it true that the building has been sold?&rdquo;
Mr. Greene pursued the matter. &ldquo;I was informed
today that the trustees have disposed of the old
church at a very high figure. I was given to understand
that the structure will be demolished, the materials
salvaged and another building constructed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Maxwell drew in his breath, astonished by
the Court director&rsquo;s knowledge. Then surprisingly,
he relaxed and smiled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, we have sold the building,&rdquo; he admitted.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right. We can afford to forgive and
forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, everyone suddenly seemed in good
humor. Mrs. Hatfield pressed a cup of chocolate
into Mr. Maxwell&rsquo;s hand, while Midge&rsquo;s mother
urged Mr. Brennan to have &ldquo;just one more cookie.&rdquo;
Soon everyone was laughing and talking together,
and past events were entirely forgotten.</p>
<p>Pat and the other Purple Five players would have
slipped away, had Dan not stopped them. They too
were urged to remain for music and refreshments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess they aren&rsquo;t going to send me to jail after
all,&rdquo; Pat said, sipping his hot chocolate with keen
enjoyment. &ldquo;It was a close call though!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better be careful in the future,&rdquo; Dan advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; Pat agreed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re through with all
that stuff. Y&rsquo;know, it only gets you into trouble. No
more smashing windows or swiping things for us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such as ice cream freezers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, we took &rsquo;em that night of the party,&rdquo; Pat
admitted sheepishly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been ashamed of it
ever since too. The Cubs were swell to us&mdash;treated
us square even when we were mean to them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Cubs always try to do things the right way,&rdquo;
Dan replied. &ldquo;You know the code?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A Cub is Fair; A Cub is Happy; A Cub is
Game.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And above all, a Cub values his honor,&rdquo; added
Mr. Hatfield, who had overheard the two boys talking.
&ldquo;Thanks to you, Pat, Den 2 again will have a
good name in Webster City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pat cast his eyes down, still feeling ashamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be great to be a Cub and belong to the
Pack,&rdquo; he said at length. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot better than a
gang, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A great deal better, Pat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Cubs wouldn&rsquo;t be for&mdash;for kids like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield asked quietly. &ldquo;From
the start, I had hoped to interest you boys in the
organization. That was why I favored the basketball
games.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean we can join the Cubs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly can,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield assured him.
&ldquo;Since you live in another part of town it wouldn&rsquo;t
be practical to come here often. But you could have
your own den. I&rsquo;ll help you find a leader and organize.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will?&rdquo; Pat&rsquo;s freckled face lighted like a
Christmas tree. &ldquo;Gee! Wait until I tell the fellows!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bay Shore boys all shared Pat&rsquo;s desire to
join the Cub organization. Eagerly they asked for
detailed information. Pat especially wanted to know
if they might play another series of basketball games
the following season.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield promised. &ldquo;Den 2 will
be glad to play your den.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our den!&rdquo; Pat liked the sound of the word.
&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s something! We&rsquo;ll have uniforms too,
won&rsquo;t we? And pins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything that goes with Cubbing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just one thing more,&rdquo; Pat said. He cast
his eyes down, and then went on quickly. &ldquo;About
wrecking that cardboard fort. A couple of the
fellows did it and then were sorry. If we could
rebuild it or anything&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk about that later,&rdquo; Mr. Hatfield said.
&ldquo;Just now, so that you&rsquo;ll feel you&rsquo;re really being
taken into one of the finest organizations in the
world, we want to introduce you to the Living
Circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Pat asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll show you,&rdquo; Dan offered.</p>

<p>Joining with the Bay Shore boys, the Cubs formed
a circle. Each youngster faced inward, extending
his left hand, palm downward, into the circle. Each
Cub then grasped the thumb of the boy to his right,
raising his free hand in the organization&rsquo;s sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we really Cubs now?&rdquo; Pat asked, his eyes
gleaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, but soon,&rdquo; Dan answered with a friendly
grin. &ldquo;You fellows have plenty to learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The salute?&rdquo; Pat chuckled. &ldquo;Nothing to that.&rdquo;
He raised his right hand, smartly paying deference
to all the Cubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are even more important things, Pat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I know?&rdquo; the Bay Shore boy drawled.
&ldquo;Honor and honesty and loyalty to friends. It may
take me a long while, but with your help, Dan,
someday I&rsquo;ll be the fairest, squarest Cub of the
lot!&rdquo;</p>
